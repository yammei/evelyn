ted (20:04:29 PM):  ok i am ready
lynn (20:04:33 PM):  hi
moderator (20:04:53 PM):  cinthia do you mind being the leader tonight?
cinthia (20:05:06 PM):  sure
moderator (20:05:11 PM):  You just have to ensure that the discussion stays on track and that a consensus is reached.
moderator (20:05:14 PM):  Great, thanks.
cinthia (20:05:18 PM):  dealio
moderator (20:05:18 PM):  You may begin now.
cinthia (20:05:29 PM):  alright guys everyone read the topic today?
irene (20:05:37 PM):  yes
lynn (20:05:37 PM):  yes
ted (20:05:51 PM):  yep
cinthia (20:05:55 PM):  anyone have any ideas yet to who is best or not?
irene (20:06:06 PM):  i wasn't too impressed with anyone
lynn (20:06:12 PM):  for me it was between natalie and jeremy
lynn (20:06:17 PM):  but only barely
irene (20:06:27 PM):  brian has experience with nursing
cinthia (20:06:32 PM):  that is a plus
ted (20:06:46 PM):  for me natalie
lynn (20:06:51 PM):  yes, although the job requirements say that isn't necessary. but of course it helps in an emergency
irene (20:06:59 PM):  i mean tehy don't need to be a nurse but it helps
irene (20:07:04 PM):  old people are fragile
cinthia (20:07:22 PM):  ya... nursing would be really good cuz as ppl get older they kinda get crazy
lynn (20:07:23 PM):  jeremy was cpr certified
cinthia (20:08:04 PM):  lets talk about them one at a time... start with elizabeth
lynn (20:08:26 PM):  wait, i didn't get a aresume for an elizabeth.....did i miss her?
cinthia (20:08:40 PM):  the only thing she really has is experience with childcare (still care) and hospital volunteer
cinthia (20:08:46 PM):  woops megan i mean
lynn (20:08:51 PM):  ok, got it
lynn (20:09:12 PM):  she's also worked with money, and if she's taking client's money to buy food, that could show trust
irene (20:09:22 PM):  oh yeah
irene (20:09:23 PM):  good point
josh (20:09:24 PM):  yea thats true
cinthia (20:09:30 PM):  thats true to some extent
irene (20:09:34 PM):  very important
lynn (20:10:01 PM):  i also kind of liked that she was in a creative field, because these people will have to be "companions" as well and talk to them about lots of topics
irene (20:10:14 PM):  she was also a food service worker so she can get the groceries quickly!
ted (20:10:32 PM):  she definately has experience talking to people
irene (20:10:38 PM):  yes indeed
lynn (20:10:43 PM):  the one time food service comes in handy!
cinthia (20:10:44 PM):  companionship def
irene (20:10:49 PM):  def
josh (20:10:51 PM):  yea
ted (20:10:59 PM):  good point about getting food and groceries quickly
irene (20:11:22 PM):  hospital volunteer too
lynn (20:11:22 PM):  she also specifically wanted a job as a senior assistant
cinthia (20:11:23 PM):  alright next candidate... megan seems to be a kinda good fit
irene (20:11:28 PM):  yeah i guess she's a good candidate...
irene (20:11:29 PM):  okay
lynn (20:11:33 PM):  yes, she was one of my tops
irene (20:11:37 PM):  she is now
irene (20:11:40 PM):  on my tops too
cinthia (20:11:43 PM):  ditto
irene (20:11:52 PM):  ualbany fund deals with thousands of dollars as well
irene (20:11:55 PM):  and credit card information
lynn (20:11:57 PM):  alexander is a smart guy, but seems like he's too business oriented, and maybe a better fit for management
lynn (20:12:02 PM):  true
cinthia (20:12:13 PM):  yeah thats wat im thikning
irene (20:12:24 PM):  yeah
irene (20:12:36 PM):  but he's dealt with struggling urban students
irene (20:12:42 PM):  so old people should be easier
ted (20:12:48 PM):  does not seem the type of person to work with the elderly
irene (20:12:59 PM):  i'm sure he could do it but we can eliminate him
lynn (20:13:10 PM):  he wasn't one of my tops
irene (20:13:17 PM):  yeah
cinthia (20:13:19 PM):  no he doesnt seem to offer much
josh (20:13:31 PM):  yea megan is a better fit than him
ted (20:13:33 PM):  does not have relevant experience to any of the duties
lynn (20:13:37 PM):  i agree
irene (20:13:38 PM):  other than being good with money
lynn (20:13:43 PM):  right
irene (20:13:43 PM):  whcih another person is as well
lynn (20:14:25 PM):  i liked natalie because she has experience delivering meals, ,and worked as a red cross volunteer
irene (20:14:33 PM):  yes that's very good
lynn (20:14:35 PM):  she also specifically wanted this type of position
irene (20:14:55 PM):  and she was a sales associate...definitely need lots of patience for that
ted (20:14:56 PM):  she definately knows what she is getting into
ted (20:14:59 PM):  that is a plus
lynn (20:15:07 PM):  ha-ha, true about sales associates
irene (20:15:08 PM):  red cross is very good experience, very impressive
irene (20:15:10 PM):  and human services intern
irene (20:15:14 PM):  she was one of my top choices
cinthia (20:15:16 PM):  natalie didnt deliver the food tho
cinthia (20:15:24 PM):  she was an intern that trained the deliverers
irene (20:15:25 PM):  i'm sure she can handle groceries
lynn (20:15:44 PM):  that's true, although she knows the logistics involved
josh (20:15:53 PM):  yea but if she trained them then that means she can do it
irene (20:15:59 PM):  yeah
ted (20:16:06 PM):  working at gap definately exposed her to all age ranges
ted (20:16:37 PM):  the human service experience is the most valuable
cinthia (20:16:38 PM):  thats more toward like 18-30
cinthia (20:16:47 PM):  but i see what ur saying
ted (20:17:06 PM):  well most of the time 18 - 30
lynn (20:17:11 PM):  she at least knows how to deal with the public
josh (20:17:15 PM):  yea
ted (20:17:16 PM):  but they do get all other age groups
irene (20:17:54 PM):  she's impressive
lynn (20:18:03 PM):  i agree
irene (20:18:07 PM):  she stood out to me right from the start
cinthia (20:18:45 PM):  how about jeremy
ted (20:19:12 PM):  something that i am worried about is that
lynn (20:19:19 PM):  i liked him, too, ,because he wants this kind of position
lynn (20:19:40 PM):  he also has experience driving people around, and that shows that he can be on time for getting people places
ted (20:19:43 PM):  he had a job as a welfare specialist, but he is seeking an entry level job
ted (20:19:58 PM):  kind of weird
josh (20:20:04 PM):  yea and his welfare specialist position gives him some experience
irene (20:20:29 PM):  yeah
josh (20:20:47 PM):  maybe thats cuz he wants a job he thinks he can def get
cinthia (20:20:47 PM):  he seems to be a top runner
lynn (20:21:08 PM):  what do you make of the fact that he specified he financed his own education?
ted (20:21:44 PM):  i always worried about people that over qualified cause they will continue to job hunt
irene (20:21:54 PM):  that's a good point ted
josh (20:22:00 PM):  yea it is
irene (20:22:05 PM):  but anyone can do that
cinthia (20:22:24 PM):  i havent even graduated and i still job hunt haha
irene (20:22:29 PM):  haha
josh (20:22:34 PM):  and he is cpr certified which is good to have
lynn (20:22:36 PM):  i am always job hunting, even though i have a job
josh (20:22:36 PM):  its a plus
lynn (20:22:40 PM):  yes, josh
cinthia (20:22:58 PM):  we should pry look for someone that will stay tho
cinthia (20:23:07 PM):  that way they can build a trust n relationship
lynn (20:23:11 PM):  i liked jeremy because he's worked with families, settling disputes between them, and that could be an issue for caring for elderly patients
lynn (20:23:19 PM):  yes, that's a good point
lynn (20:23:24 PM):  about the trust
josh (20:24:11 PM):  thats a good point lynn
ted (20:25:15 PM):  but the job does not require a cpr certification
ted (20:25:35 PM):  it is more about running errands
irene (20:25:37 PM):  yeah
irene (20:26:05 PM):  they must be a good companion though
irene (20:26:13 PM):  seniors get lonely
josh (20:26:21 PM):  yea
lynn (20:26:30 PM):  yes
irene (20:26:44 PM):  i wonder if this is a real job ad
lynn (20:26:47 PM):  he seems to genuinely care though
ted (20:26:48 PM):  someone with lots of people skills, patience
lynn (20:27:01 PM):  as a welfare worker
lynn (20:27:15 PM):  compassionate, ,which is good for this position
cinthia (20:27:35 PM):  yeah
ted (20:27:41 PM):  i just don't trus this guy much
cinthia (20:27:43 PM):  older folks need attn just like children
ted (20:27:52 PM):  he has a deegree in sociology
ted (20:27:58 PM):  not in human services
lynn (20:28:17 PM):  but he has more practical experience than anybody else in human services
irene (20:28:52 PM):  hm
irene (20:29:12 PM):  i agree with lynn - a welfare worker is compassionate
ted (20:30:02 PM):  i would not hire him just by reading his resume
ted (20:30:09 PM):  i will have to interview him.
irene (20:30:16 PM):  agreed
cinthia (20:30:20 PM):  well we can interview so well have to eliminate
cinthia (20:30:36 PM):  cant*
ted (20:31:12 PM):  wanna talk about brian now?
lynn (20:31:30 PM):  brian would be good as a home health worker, but i didn't see him in this position
cinthia (20:31:32 PM):  yeah lets
josh (20:31:37 PM):  yea
josh (20:31:46 PM):  hes the best for nursing
irene (20:31:49 PM):  he has so much nursing experience
josh (20:31:56 PM):  but thats not wut we are lloking for
irene (20:32:01 PM):  and he has cpr skills
irene (20:32:04 PM):  that's true but it's very helpful
josh (20:32:08 PM):  yea
irene (20:32:18 PM):  and maybe he could end up being a stay in home nurse
lynn (20:32:23 PM):  agreed that cpr might be helpful
josh (20:32:29 PM):  yea
irene (20:32:36 PM):  i think a nurse is ideal for this
josh (20:32:38 PM):  he does have communication skills tho
irene (20:32:38 PM):  a friendly nurse though
ted (20:32:43 PM):  he had time management experience
irene (20:32:51 PM):  yeah i liked him a lot from the beginning when i read him ebfore the chat
irene (20:32:55 PM):  yeah ted that's good too
ted (20:33:00 PM):  he might be good scheduling deliverys
irene (20:33:12 PM):  and old people love talking about their pills
lynn (20:33:18 PM):  hehe
ted (20:33:19 PM):  haha
lynn (20:34:03 PM):  he also has experience organizaing patients appt times and records, which is important
lynn (20:34:15 PM):  but not necessarily getting them there
ted (20:34:39 PM):  he has not graduated yet, though
cinthia (20:34:45 PM):  yeah but u only have to be 18
irene (20:34:53 PM):  other people might be juggling jobs or school as well
irene (20:35:03 PM):  we just have to ask them what their availability is
ted (20:35:03 PM):  his availability may be limited
lynn (20:35:37 PM):  that's a good point
cinthia (20:35:51 PM):  yeah but if he wants it bad enough he can change his school sched around
irene (20:36:06 PM):  maybe
irene (20:36:20 PM):  i mean this might help him for his future job
irene (20:36:23 PM):  as a stay-in nurse
lynn (20:36:23 PM):  to a certain degree, yes, but if his client has a problem, he needs to be there
lynn (20:36:47 PM):  i agree with that, it would help him in his future job as a stay-at-home nurse
irene (20:37:05 PM):  but then again we might want someone to have this as their permanent job
cinthia (20:37:57 PM):  true that
ted (20:38:05 PM):  this experience will not help him increase nursing skills
lynn (20:38:06 PM):  i worry that he would want to be a more conventiional nurse, at a hospital or something. i mean, he seems to be a talented student in nursing, and he doesn't necessarily have volunteer experience in a community setting
lynn (20:38:25 PM):  i'm sure hospital nurses get paid more
josh (20:38:35 PM):  yea but he also has the service skills with working at applebees
irene (20:38:56 PM):  yeah you have to deal with all kinds of impatient people when you're a waiter/waitress
josh (20:38:57 PM):  so he can take their orders
irene (20:39:01 PM):  hah
lynn (20:39:10 PM):  yes, but all the other candidates have community involvement as volunteers, which it hink shows more commitment to social services than a job at applebee's
irene (20:39:22 PM):  true
lynn (20:39:40 PM):  i mean he had a job there, doesn't mean he was good at it, maybe he was rude to them
ted (20:39:47 PM):  i am still worried about his availability
irene (20:39:50 PM):  yeah
ted (20:40:02 PM):  in case the senior needs pills or medicine
cinthia (20:40:15 PM):  ok so overall who did we like best
lynn (20:40:29 PM):  i liked megan natalie and jeremy
cinthia (20:41:31 PM):  exactly
cinthia (20:41:33 PM):  me too
ted (20:42:00 PM):  natalie or megan
irene (20:42:08 PM):  he was there long enough though so i doubt he was too rude
lynn (20:42:29 PM):  you're probably right
cinthia (20:42:56 PM):  so top 3
cinthia (20:42:58 PM):  lets debate those
irene (20:43:03 PM):  yeah
ted (20:43:09 PM):  ok
irene (20:43:10 PM):  those are my top 3 too
lynn (20:43:22 PM):  it's a tough choice
josh (20:43:37 PM):  yea it is
lynn (20:44:33 PM):  i liked megan, but i wonder as a literature major if this would be rewarding for her to stay for a long time
ted (20:46:11 PM):  she has not worked since 07
irene (20:46:15 PM):  well as a literature major what is she going to work for
irene (20:46:20 PM):  she might just write books on the side
lynn (20:46:21 PM):  hehe, true
irene (20:46:24 PM):  she should have a consistent job
lynn (20:46:46 PM):  she works at mcdonald's now
ted (20:46:58 PM):  oh sorry, she did not write her resume cronologically
ted (20:47:01 PM):  my bad
irene (20:47:14 PM):  well that's a good sign lol
ted (20:47:21 PM):  that shows that she is messy
lynn (20:47:25 PM):  she seemed "young" to me, out of all the 3, even though i know they are all the same age probably
ted (20:47:41 PM):  she will mess up orders
lynn (20:47:54 PM):  yes, haha, old people like young people, i think
lynn (20:47:59 PM):  like having them around
lynn (20:48:23 PM):  but for some reason, natalie seems "older" and perhaps a bit more mature. she has an associates degree as well as a ba in human services
ted (20:48:23 PM):  what is MESA Club?
lynn (20:48:48 PM):  i don't know
josh (20:48:54 PM):  i was about to ask the same lol
irene (20:49:18 PM):  well i googled it
irene (20:49:24 PM):  middle eastern studies association?
josh (20:49:45 PM):  o so that means nothin to us then lol
lynn (20:49:58 PM):  nor to the clients, i'm afraid
cinthia (20:50:08 PM):  oh well shows diversity
lynn (20:50:12 PM):  yes
lynn (20:50:19 PM):  she's open-minded, which is good
josh (20:50:37 PM):  yea but thats not a big point for this job
lynn (20:50:42 PM):  right, i agree
irene (20:50:47 PM):  well the point is to be compassionate
irene (20:50:53 PM):  and usually being open minded and being compassionate go hand in hand
cinthia (20:51:19 PM):  how so?
irene (20:51:52 PM):  i guess that's just an opinion
irene (20:52:09 PM):  i just don't think you can be close minded and compassionate
irene (20:52:12 PM):  at least not usually
cinthia (20:52:13 PM):  i kinda see wat ur saying tho
irene (20:52:26 PM):  yeah
irene (20:52:29 PM):  not the biggest issue here
irene (20:52:37 PM):  idk who i want
irene (20:52:39 PM):  who's everyone's top choice
lynn (20:52:48 PM):  i agree with irene, especially with the middle east, there are a lot of people who could easily just hate, but she chose to find out more. i agree it's not the most important consideration in our case, though
lynn (20:53:05 PM):  i think for me it's natalie
josh (20:53:07 PM):  good point
ted (20:53:09 PM):  good point
ted (20:53:32 PM):  i am all for natalie
ted (20:54:22 PM):  i am thinking why she lists her gpa twice?
cinthia (20:54:29 PM):  mistake
lynn (20:54:40 PM):  two different degrees
josh (20:54:53 PM):  its the gpa for may
cinthia (20:55:15 PM):  for the different years
irene (20:55:17 PM):  yeah two different subjects
josh (20:55:17 PM):  ones 2010 and the other is 2007\
irene (20:55:20 PM):  major and overall
irene (20:55:22 PM):  or that
cinthia (20:55:26 PM):  yep so all 4 years of college
irene (20:55:33 PM):  the gpa is irrelevant in my opnion
cinthia (20:55:33 PM):  pry just showing how she maintained her grades
irene (20:55:35 PM):  *opinion
irene (20:55:43 PM):  i mean it's good to put
irene (20:55:49 PM):  but it wouldn't decide anything for me
ted (20:55:56 PM):  i really like this candidate that is why i am asking everything about her
lynn (20:56:04 PM):  i completely agree with that, i don't even know why it's asked for
ted (20:56:53 PM):  resumes tell quite of bit about an applicant
irene (20:56:56 PM):  yeah
lynn (20:57:40 PM):  can anybody find a compelling reason not to pick natalie?
josh (20:57:56 PM):  nope
irene (20:57:57 PM):  good question
ted (20:58:02 PM):  i think this job experience will be a growth opportunity for her, in a field that she wants to be in
irene (20:58:18 PM):  she didn't put her phone number!
irene (20:58:18 PM):  haha
lynn (20:58:23 PM):  hehe
irene (20:58:25 PM):  actually i don't thikn anyone did
lynn (20:58:27 PM):  she's so out...
lynn (20:58:30 PM):  just kidding
ted (20:58:40 PM):  wow you are strict
irene (20:58:41 PM):  but the last time we had a similar topic like this i think they put like (123)456-789
irene (20:58:46 PM):  or whatever
irene (20:58:56 PM):  well certain jobs are honestly that strict
irene (20:58:58 PM):  if it's really competitive
irene (20:59:18 PM):  yeah i don't see anything wrong with her though
ted (20:59:23 PM):  well i would not wanna have lynn interviewing me lol
irene (20:59:30 PM):  haha
irene (20:59:35 PM):  :-p
josh (21:00:42 PM):  so are we saying natalie is our choice
ted (21:00:47 PM):  i would call natalie to offer her the job. too bad she did not write it
ted (21:01:25 PM):  down
lynn (21:01:35 PM):  her loss
lynn (21:01:44 PM):  no seriously, i think natalie is our choice
lynn (21:01:52 PM):  unless anybody disagrees or wants to discuss more
irene (21:02:34 PM):  haha
cinthia (21:02:37 PM):  i think natali
irene (21:02:38 PM):  yeah well we have a half hour
irene (21:02:41 PM):  but natalie is the winner
josh (21:02:44 PM):  yea
josh (21:02:58 PM):  they always give us too much time to do this
lynn (21:03:02 PM):  cool, she'll be happy to know that.
irene (21:03:02 PM):  yes
lynn (21:03:06 PM):  i know, they do!
lynn (21:03:24 PM):  although i was on a chat the other day and we actually needed more time. we never reached a consensus either
lynn (21:03:36 PM):  there was one holdout
cinthia (21:03:38 PM):  what was that topic?
irene (21:03:52 PM):  yeah that's a shocker
lynn (21:03:56 PM):  we had to pick a city for the US olympics to be in
lynn (21:04:05 PM):  not an international olympics, ,but just a domestic one
irene (21:04:05 PM):  oh yeah i had that too
lynn (21:04:14 PM):  were you on that chat??
josh (21:04:18 PM):  oo well thats a good one tho
irene (21:04:23 PM):  idk if i was with you
irene (21:04:31 PM):  but a lot of times both groups have the same topic
lynn (21:04:31 PM):  yea, it was a great topic, i thought.
irene (21:04:32 PM):  like right now
lynn (21:04:35 PM):  that's true
josh (21:04:39 PM):  all the ones i have had take like 45 mins to do lol
irene (21:04:43 PM):  yeah
lynn (21:04:47 PM):  did you reach a concensus, irene?
irene (21:04:53 PM):  yeah
irene (21:04:56 PM):  i forgot what we picked
lynn (21:04:58 PM):  oh cool
lynn (21:05:02 PM):  we picked st. louis
irene (21:05:03 PM):  i have a bad memory
lynn (21:05:13 PM):  but she held out for chicago, the only one
irene (21:05:32 PM):  i haven't had a topic i felt strongly about
irene (21:05:53 PM):  they should put more controversial topics
lynn (21:05:56 PM):  me neither
irene (21:05:57 PM):  like abortion or something
lynn (21:06:02 PM):  oh, wow
cinthia (21:06:03 PM):  ehhh they pry do that for a reason
irene (21:06:06 PM):  they would get strong reactions out of people
lynn (21:06:10 PM):  yes, definitely
irene (21:06:12 PM):  and we'd have plenty of things to say
ted (21:06:14 PM):  education?
irene (21:06:27 PM):  maybe they'll do that in the face-to-face chat
lynn (21:06:34 PM):  yes, perhaps
cinthia (21:06:38 PM):  alright guys
cinthia (21:06:45 PM):  lets try to get back on topic for the last 30
irene (21:06:48 PM):  k
lynn (21:06:49 PM):  how about toilet paper over or under?
irene (21:06:52 PM):  hahahah
lynn (21:06:53 PM):  oh, ,sorry
irene (21:07:05 PM):  we should ask that on the interview
lynn (21:07:08 PM):  hehe
ted (21:07:18 PM):  i think we had a good debate
ted (21:07:21 PM):  haha
irene (21:07:25 PM):  yeah
irene (21:07:32 PM):  we did the job
irene (21:07:38 PM):  discussed it and reached a cnsensus
lynn (21:07:40 PM):  one thing that surprisingly made a difference for me was if they listed their goal or objective
irene (21:07:44 PM):  but we can talk about why the other 2 weren't picked
ted (21:07:51 PM):  everybody gave input about each applicant
cinthia (21:08:02 PM):  yeah good point lynn
ted (21:08:05 PM):  we followed a good pattern
irene (21:08:16 PM):  yeah lynn that's a good point
lynn (21:08:32 PM):  i will keep that in mind from now on as i apply for jobs
cinthia (21:09:04 PM):  i think its like ur foot in the door for the job
cinthia (21:09:17 PM):  im the recruiting intern at a company and thats what we really look for
lynn (21:09:25 PM):  really?
lynn (21:09:34 PM):  i always thought it was so useless to put that
lynn (21:09:54 PM):  that was surprising to me
irene (21:10:03 PM):  there are certain things that are dumb but jobs want to see
irene (21:10:06 PM):  i.e. gpa
cinthia (21:10:28 PM):  yeah thats not the biggest factor tho
cinthia (21:10:33 PM):  that kinda is a commitment thing
josh (21:10:36 PM):  so ur saying to put an objective?
cinthia (21:10:37 PM):  to see how well you apply yourself
irene (21:10:40 PM):  yeah
ted (21:10:48 PM):  well gpa gre sat are all used as filters
irene (21:10:58 PM):  ugh
irene (21:11:00 PM):  i hate those
irene (21:11:03 PM):  that would be a good chat
josh (21:11:11 PM):  yea it would
lynn (21:11:15 PM):  i just think gpa nowadays doesn't mean much, because grades vary so much depending on where you went to school
irene (21:11:19 PM):  yeah
josh (21:11:23 PM):  yea
irene (21:11:25 PM):  and who taught the class
lynn (21:11:31 PM):  yes, exactly
ted (21:11:39 PM):  and the curve!!!
irene (21:11:43 PM):  yeah
josh (21:11:49 PM):  its just a way to weed out people when alot of people are going for a job
cinthia (21:11:59 PM):  yep right josh
lynn (21:12:09 PM):  yea, i can see hiring somebody who has a 3.5 over a 1.7
irene (21:12:19 PM):  well yeah
lynn (21:12:24 PM):  but when it comes to 3.5 vs. 3.1, it doesn't mean much
ted (21:12:37 PM):  or a 0.65
josh (21:12:40 PM):  well there are computer programs that look at certain #s on a resume
cinthia (21:12:52 PM):  explain
ted (21:12:58 PM):  that is a new one i have not heard
lynn (21:13:03 PM):  at my grad school, they have a new gpa configuration where they include what the rest of your graduating class got
lynn (21:13:08 PM):  so it puts you in relation to others
ted (21:13:25 PM):  a standart distribution?
lynn (21:13:27 PM):  what does that involve, josh?
josh (21:13:51 PM):  the company puts certain info into the computer that they look for on a resume
lynn (21:14:02 PM):  text?
josh (21:14:25 PM):  so they may put that they want people wit gpas over 3.5
lynn (21:14:32 PM):  oh, i see
josh (21:14:50 PM):  so #s that come up lower than 3.5 get thrown away
cinthia (21:14:58 PM):  like an excel program
cinthia (21:14:58 PM):  got it
irene (21:15:54 PM):  yeah
irene (21:15:59 PM):  i've heard of things like that
irene (21:16:11 PM):  but this is just dealing with seniors who need help doing things that most people can do
lynn (21:16:25 PM):  right
josh (21:16:33 PM):  yea so gpa doesnt really matter
lynn (21:16:45 PM):  they all had pretty similar gpa's anyhow
irene (21:17:05 PM):  yeha
josh (21:17:37 PM):  true
ted (21:18:01 PM):  can we end this
irene (21:18:06 PM):  no
irene (21:18:06 PM):  haha
irene (21:18:11 PM):  we have to wait til 930
irene (21:18:18 PM):  when moderator announces it is over
irene (21:18:20 PM):  then we take a survey
ted (21:18:35 PM):  i know
irene (21:18:47 PM):  i think we all put in an equal amount of work
lynn (21:18:51 PM):  we were very efficient!
irene (21:18:51 PM):  i don't know how i'm going to rate everyone
irene (21:18:53 PM):  yes

amy (8:25:25 PM):  u?
mara (8:26:14 PM):  fine... i have so much work to do right now
mara (8:26:22 PM):  im stressing out a bit! haha

mara (8:26:47 PM):  well no im a graduate student so mostly papers... no more tests ever haha
mara (8:26:59 PM):  but i dont know what is better really!!!
john (8:27:10 PM):  Sorry for being late.
amy (8:27:24 PM):  lol  i know what you mean.... i took just one grad class this semester and it was rought writing papers all the time
amy (8:27:32 PM):  hi john
john (8:27:51 PM):  hi
amy (8:28:16 PM):  looks like just the 3 of us for now- i told mara how nick and jordan havent responded in here yet since i was here
john (8:28:20 PM):  my computer seems to be slow
mara (8:28:23 PM):  haha im taking FOUR!
mara (8:28:30 PM):  hi john
amy (8:28:39 PM):  woah- that is a lot of writing!
mara (8:28:43 PM):  never met you before now..
john (8:28:51 PM):  hi mara
amy (8:29:07 PM):  i havent been here with you either john
john (8:29:21 PM):  yes,  i am a new comer haha
amy (8:29:29 PM):  did you both get the job descrip stuff?
mara (8:29:37 PM):  so no jor or nick huh?
mara (8:29:41 PM):  yah i did
mara (8:29:46 PM):  we can start now i guess
john (8:29:55 PM):  yes I just reading now
amy (8:30:05 PM):  sure hopefully they'll get in here sooner or later
amy (8:30:20 PM):  i read them briefly also just  a few mins ago
mara (8:31:20 PM):  yeah me too... i feel like this is a weird job to have to give a resume for haha
mara (8:31:31 PM):  an application is enough i think
amy (8:31:46 PM):  hiring for a cashier with no real requirements
amy (8:32:04 PM):  yeah- good point mara   since they dont say you need certain things
amy (8:32:28 PM):  i'm sure anyone in college could handle it
john (8:32:30 PM):  so do i, it seems that james is a good candidate.
mara (8:32:48 PM):  i was a cashier in highschool for god sakes... lol
amy (8:32:59 PM):  in the past, we all went through one resume at a time-  wanna start with james then?
amy (8:33:05 PM):  lol
mara (8:33:47 PM):  yeah sure
mara (8:33:53 PM):  james it is
amy (8:34:15 PM):  he's had some good work experience
mara (8:34:42 PM):  computerized business... he has some technological advancements
amy (8:34:53 PM):  mail room, ups, payroll stuff
amy (8:35:29 PM):  yeah that was strange i though-  is that like a technical college or is it a high school program?
mara (8:37:26 PM):  i think its a college program
mara (8:37:36 PM):  but his jobs seem to be irrelevant to cashier position
mara (8:37:50 PM):  the ups and mailroom stuff has nothing to do with being a cashier
amy (8:37:52 PM):  yeah- nothing money related
amy (8:38:06 PM):  he doesnt do anything for me   lol
amy (8:38:26 PM):  wanna move to Jonathan?
mara (8:39:10 PM):  sure thing
mara (8:39:47 PM):  hes not much fun either haha, what do you think?
amy (8:39:59 PM):  he seems similar to the other guy- nothing in a store
amy (8:40:16 PM):  i think we'll come across another one with more relevant exp
john (8:40:18 PM):  he was major in Computerized Business and Accounting
mara (8:40:31 PM):  hopefullyyyyyy
amy (8:40:43 PM):  oh we moved on from him-  we're looking at Jonathan now
amy (8:40:59 PM):  ok who's next???
mara (8:41:15 PM):  danielle
amy (8:41:27 PM):  k
mara (8:41:52 PM):  ughh... i dont like her either haha
amy (8:42:06 PM):  hm  still nothing!
mara (8:42:06 PM):  this job is soooo easy, but none of their resumes seem relevant
amy (8:42:14 PM):  i totally agree
john (8:42:26 PM):  hi, nobody there?
amy (8:42:30 PM):  oooh  susie was a receptionist!
mara (8:42:57 PM):  im here
amy (8:43:02 PM):  Organized the filing system for a branch office, performed general office workand made bank deposits this is from Susie
mara (8:43:03 PM):  yeah i see that hhah
amy (8:43:16 PM):  so far so good!   LOL
john (8:43:24 PM):  jordan's trying
mara (8:43:25 PM):  bank deposits!!!
mara (8:43:49 PM):  yeah i like her the best so far
amy (8:43:57 PM):  i think she's be able to handle having a boss to communicate with like the job descrip asks for
john (8:43:59 PM):  have difficulty connecting, anybody can help?
mara (8:44:03 PM):  seems like she has handled money and been in the real world
amy (8:44:07 PM):  me too-  like her best
amy (8:44:21 PM):  what a plus for a cashier position!  haha
mara (8:44:36 PM):  hey amy we have to sign off and sign back on in a  couple mins... moderator is going to restart the server ok?
amy (8:44:42 PM):  john-  did u log off and try logging in again?
amy (8:44:48 PM):  OK
mara (8:45:02 PM):  see ya in a couple... wait like 4 mins
jordan (8:48:43 PM):  hi, it works now.
amy (8:48:54 PM):  hi jordan
jordan (8:49:02 PM):  Hi, amy
amy (8:49:24 PM):  nick, did you make it in?
jordan (8:49:24 PM):  seems a lot of fun takling this way
amy (8:50:20 PM):  mara?
nick (8:52:07 PM):  HELLO
nick (8:52:17 PM):  I amde it
nick (8:52:19 PM):  made
jordan (8:52:37 PM):  they have difficulty logging in, as i just did.
nick (8:53:03 PM):  It worked much better this time :)
jordan (8:53:30 PM):  so the preparation takes lot of time, and we haven't started our discussion.
amy (8:53:58 PM):  mara, john, and i started a talk about the resumes
jordan (8:54:31 PM):  i'd like to join you, amy.
amy (8:54:58 PM):  hehe   ok
amy (8:55:07 PM):  but i dont know if she made it back in
amy (8:55:20 PM):  we can talk about any one of the resumes- pick one
jordan (8:55:54 PM):  the 1st one is ggod.
john (8:56:01 PM):  hi everyone
jordan (8:56:41 PM):  i wonder if a cashier really needs so much computer skills.
amy (8:56:48 PM):  hi john-  can you see my message here?
john (8:56:50 PM):  i can't see anybody's talking
amy (8:57:02 PM):  yeah we didnt like him so much-  no relevant experience
amy (8:57:37 PM):  that one and the next James seem to have no experience that would matter for a cashier
jordan (8:57:48 PM):  yes.
john (8:58:01 PM):  hi
amy (8:58:18 PM):  danielle has some reception work
john (8:58:19 PM):  i reset the browser
jordan (8:58:40 PM):  people tend to think the more education, the better, no matter what kind of job.
john (8:59:02 PM):  yes, she did
jordan (8:59:14 PM):  reception is still not related to cashier
john (8:59:40 PM):  I think so
jordan (8:59:53 PM):  any chance for training once he/she starts to work?
amy (9:00:09 PM):  i confused myself actually based on that previous conversation i was having with mara
amy (9:00:52 PM):  it was susie with reception and she also was an office assistant
jordan (9:00:59 PM):  Susie has language skills, helps a lot.
amy (9:01:36 PM):  i like susie a little
john (9:01:44 PM):  ii depends on which store i think
jordan (9:01:59 PM):  i want to hear other people's opinion about Susie. She seems an ideal candidate. Isn't she?
amy (9:02:12 PM):  because she's worked in office environments she's used to asnweting to a boss as the job descrip asked for
amy (9:02:32 PM):  i dont know that anyone else is here beside you (jordan), john and myself
amy (9:03:58 PM):  anyone here?
john (9:04:13 PM):  haha
jordan (9:04:26 PM):  But there are 6 blue names
jordan (9:04:54 PM):  Morgan
amy (9:04:55 PM):  yeah-  some tech problems tonight it seems-   i just sent an email to see if we should continue with just us
amy (9:05:16 PM):  same as the first ones-  no exp that says she would be good for a cashier position
john (9:05:34 PM):  sure
jordan (9:06:03 PM):  so we all agree on Susie?
john (9:06:05 PM):  james seems good
amy (9:06:25 PM):  i am for Susie
john (9:06:50 PM):  so do i ,and also james is good
amy (9:06:50 PM):  james would be my 2nd pick
amy (9:07:00 PM):  so we all think Susie!  yay
john (9:07:25 PM):  i agree with amy
jordan (9:07:31 PM):  James has good education but lacks experience. With some training, he could be better than Susie.
amy (9:07:44 PM):  absolutely
john (9:07:59 PM):  yes
jordan (9:08:06 PM):  depends whether the boss gives training.
jordan (9:08:54 PM):  mara nick have any opinions?
amy (9:09:17 PM):  i think they're having trouble logging in but are still trying
john (9:09:25 PM):  it seems they are not here
amy (9:09:46 PM):  right john
john (9:10:19 PM):  it works well since the server was restart
amy (9:10:47 PM):  yeah- at least we had some time to choose the candidate together
jordan (9:10:50 PM):  is this system a new gadget, or has sb used it before?
amy (9:11:02 PM):  what is sb?
jordan (9:11:11 PM):  somebody
amy (9:11:24 PM):  ohh    we've been using this for the study the last few weeks
jordan (9:11:35 PM):  see.
amy (9:11:39 PM):  occassionally logging in issues
john (9:11:48 PM):  ok
jordan (9:11:58 PM):  shall we have trouble logging in each time?
amy (9:12:12 PM):  we've never accomplished the goal (choosing a resume) so fast though before  - and we even had problems!
amy (9:12:20 PM):  i only trouble one other time
amy (9:12:33 PM):  only had
john (9:12:51 PM):  oh
jordan (9:13:01 PM):  I'm no computer expert. who is the technician for us?
jordan (9:13:31 PM):  why. he doesn't say a word.
amy (9:13:39 PM):  the woman working on the study
john (9:13:51 PM):  haha
amy (9:13:53 PM):  sometimes it might be the professor
jordan (9:13:54 PM):  she?
amy (9:14:03 PM):  they never write in here- send us emails
john (9:14:15 PM):  i see
jordan (9:14:33 PM):  Oh. You mean they stand apart somewhere watching us?
amy (9:14:45 PM):  jordan.....are you m or f?  it really doesnt matter but just thought to ask
amy (9:15:06 PM):  the study is to study people interacting though chat
jordan (9:15:31 PM):  That's the truble for me. "jordan" is a girlish name, but I am a man.
amy (9:15:52 PM):  it's a good name-  but yes, it can be for anyone
amy (9:15:53 PM):  :)
jordan (9:16:00 PM):  Somebody called me by this name, although I prefer to be called James.
john (9:16:06 PM):  haha, no problem. he is  male
amy (9:16:11 PM):  bet you never had to say that before "i am a man"
john (9:16:53 PM):  I am male too
jordan (9:17:33 PM):  And this is one of the tricky things in this virtual world. You know nothing about the people u r talking to!!!!
amy (9:17:48 PM):  well that is why it is quite different from being face to face
amy (9:18:00 PM):  very interesting
jordan (9:18:07 PM):  is it good or bad?
amy (9:18:16 PM):  <shrug>
jordan (9:18:22 PM):  guessing away
john (9:18:49 PM):  i like talking face to face
jordan (9:18:54 PM):  amy is always a girl's name.
amy (9:19:07 PM):  hm i suppose so   lol
amy (9:19:21 PM):  i go by "amy" also  plus its shorter to write
jordan (9:19:22 PM):  i wonder if any boy would use amy on the internet.
amy (9:19:37 PM):  people can do anything they want i guess
amy (9:19:41 PM):  online
jordan (9:19:42 PM):  what about amyy?
john (9:19:44 PM):  also a beautiful name
amy (9:19:57 PM):  she was here once or twice when i was here
john (9:20:01 PM):  maybe
jordan (9:20:37 PM):  Sorry, u missed the point. I mean amy is also a shortend form for amyy. Is it?
amy (9:20:40 PM):  are you both students?
jordan (9:20:58 PM):  a big student.
jordan (9:21:08 PM):  an old student.
amy (9:21:14 PM):  me too
john (9:21:19 PM):  yes
amy (9:21:25 PM):  an adult learner?
jordan (9:21:41 PM):  that's what they call it
amy (9:21:44 PM):  how is amy short for amyy???   lol
jordan (9:22:05 PM):  adult seems too technical a word,
jordan (9:22:21 PM):  Sorry. I mean amy is
amy (9:22:34 PM):  gotcha
amy (9:22:38 PM):  yes
jordan (9:23:07 PM):  internet doe not correct your typing mistakes, ...
amy (9:23:26 PM):  not unless you use a program
john (9:23:33 PM):  hah  it is good for me i think
jordan (9:23:38 PM):  where are we? far away from the cashier
amy (9:23:59 PM):  what is not good for you john?
amy (9:24:10 PM):  yeah, we definitely finished with the cashier
amy (9:24:21 PM):  but we chose our person
jordan (9:24:26 PM):  good.
jordan (9:24:47 PM):  Susie?
amy (9:24:51 PM):  i think they need the chat for their study though so this is probably ok too
john (9:24:53 PM):  it good for me as my english grammer is not good
amy (9:25:10 PM):  ohhh  english is your 2nd language?
jordan (9:25:27 PM):  That's what I thinked. Ha
john (9:25:31 PM):  yes
amy (9:26:00 PM):  see, i would not have know it was your 2nd...although you havent written too much, but your english is very good!
jordan (9:26:30 PM):  I wonder what conclusions they can arrive at just by watching people chat on the internet.
john (9:26:31 PM):  thank you so much,
jordan (9:27:06 PM):  there are strange things in this world.
amy (9:27:40 PM):  i dunno what they look for specifically-  but people behave differently online
jordan (9:27:41 PM):  my second thought is internet chat is worth studying.
john (9:27:47 PM):  maybe i think it is important for the process that we are chatting
amy (9:28:26 PM):  yes
jordan (9:28:40 PM):  people nowadays chat a lot on the internet, but management is insufficient.
amy (9:28:53 PM):  well it is the way the world is going-- email, chat,, etc
john (9:28:58 PM):  so i think our chatting behavior is important for thire experiment
amy (9:29:09 PM):  peple run businesses and dont even know they're employees
amy (9:29:34 PM):  what kind of management?
jordan (9:30:06 PM):  Although i'm no linguist, i am very concerned about the correct use of english. but the internet has brought about a considerable havok on it. Do you agree?
amy (9:30:19 PM):  i agree
john (9:30:26 PM):  virtual
amy (9:30:27 PM):  i worry about young people
jordan (9:30:56 PM):  people, even professor, ignore right spelling, punctuation, grammar,.... you name it.
john (9:31:04 PM):  sure, there are more and more conmmunication
john (9:31:11 PM):  sorry
john (9:31:17 PM):  less and less
amy (9:31:27 PM):  but that is not ignored when it comes to writing papers, etc
amy (9:31:44 PM):  so it's like there are two different ways of communicating (?)
jordan (9:31:45 PM):  right.
john (9:31:52 PM):  but they need more and more i mearn the youth
amy (9:31:56 PM):  pretty interesting
jordan (9:32:09 PM):  yes, two different ways of interacting.
amy (9:32:12 PM):  more of what john?
john (9:32:47 PM):  they need more and more face to face coummunication
amy (9:32:56 PM):  ohh
amy (9:33:08 PM):  i think it's important also
jordan (9:33:29 PM):  i once read students essays, written the way they chat on the internet.  i almost died of reading such things.
amy (9:33:51 PM):  oh that would be horrible to read!
john (9:34:06 PM):  hah yes
amy (9:34:09 PM):  never any complete sentences, acronyms
amy (9:34:22 PM):  jump from one topic to another
john (9:34:41 PM):  it is online language
jordan (9:35:18 PM):  but think this way. don't you think quite a few people are wrting much too awkwardly.
amy (9:35:32 PM):  john are you in the US now or somewhere else?
jordan (9:35:42 PM):  you know what "stop" mean ?
amy (9:35:46 PM):  online or on paper, jordan?
jordan (9:36:01 PM):  online.
john (9:36:11 PM):  i am in philadelphia now
amy (9:36:20 PM):  so you think they write awkward when writing online?
amy (9:36:44 PM):  i was just curious because that would have been really interesting if you were somewhere else in the world   : )
jordan (9:36:48 PM):  acronym for same time old place. used for rendesvouz......Ha
john (9:36:58 PM):  seam time old place
amy (9:37:22 PM):  oh i just got that-  never heard that before
john (9:37:33 PM):  also the same situation in chinese i think,haha
jordan (9:38:17 PM):  How can that happen? How can CHinese be used as acronyms?
jordan (9:39:30 PM):  another, quite differnt system of writing and speaking, i think.
john (9:39:52 PM):  one of my american friend told me even she can't understand what her daughter said sometimes
jordan (9:40:21 PM):  well, it's fun talking about so many things
jordan (9:40:39 PM):  with people from all over America.
amy (9:40:40 PM):  i've seen the translation written for parents so they can learn about what their kids write about
amy (9:40:56 PM):  where are you james?
jordan (9:41:01 PM):  oh?
jordan (9:41:29 PM):  UPenn
amy (9:41:35 PM):  yeah- because kids might be getting into trouble
john (9:42:26 PM):  it is interesting use online language in the real world
jordan (9:42:48 PM):  looking back at what we have written, i see we three are in favor of correct english, aren't we?
amy (9:42:50 PM):  wouldnt people think you're crazy if that happened?  online lang in real world?
amy (9:43:12 PM):  correct english online?
jordan (9:43:14 PM):  sure.
john (9:43:26 PM):  sure i think so hhah
amy (9:43:32 PM):  yeah but i can understand the need to use acronyms or to shorten things up
john (9:43:44 PM):  but it helps sometimes
jordan (9:43:52 PM):  well, i understand too.
jordan (9:44:05 PM):  iut
jordan (9:44:26 PM):  know what i meant?
john (9:44:30 PM):  yes maybe we need some acronyms sometimes
amy (9:44:30 PM):  i would hope kids are not online so much though that they get that kind of quick language instilled in them
john (9:44:56 PM):  sure
amy (9:45:27 PM):  when i text message people i tend to come up with my own words   lol
amy (9:45:38 PM):  bc its difficult for me to type the letters
jordan (9:45:40 PM):  yes u r right, "instill" is the very right word for the whole process, amy. they get everything, good or bad, instilled.
jordan (9:45:43 PM):  without knowing it.
john (9:46:16 PM):  absolutly
jordan (9:46:18 PM):  letters?
amy (9:46:20 PM):  u r right   you just used online language   haha
jordan (9:46:52 PM):  do you mean ABC, or mil?
jordan (9:47:02 PM):  maiil
jordan (9:47:04 PM):  sorry, mail
jordan (9:47:40 PM):  heeee! i can still corrcect myself.

amy (9:48:33 PM):  it looks like we hit our mark-  10pm
jordan (9:48:54 PM):  should we say bye to the manager?

lynn (10:01:22 AM):  morning
moderator (10:02:07 AM):  Since there are 4 of you now, we can begin!
moderator (10:02:14 AM):  Just have to ask someone to be the leader...
moderator (10:02:19 AM):  any volunteers?
moderator (10:02:50 AM):  jake, you haven't led before, right?
jake (10:03:16 AM):  no i havent
jake (10:03:20 AM):  ill lead
moderator (10:03:22 AM):  Would you mind?
moderator (10:03:28 AM):  Great, thanks!
moderator (10:03:34 AM):  Please begin whenever you're ready...
jake (10:03:47 AM):  alright ladies, lets start. any thoughts?
lynn (10:04:09 AM):  for me, from that initial list, only george w. bush and obama even came close
lynn (10:04:21 AM):  sorry, osama, not obama
lynn (10:04:28 AM):  but i wouldn't vote for them
moderator (10:04:43 AM):  Hey ariel - could you please join group A.
jake (10:04:46 AM):  to be efficient, we can go through the list and see if they fit the categories mentioned. ill keep a tally
ariel (10:04:51 AM):  sure
lynn (10:04:53 AM):  ok
melany (10:04:53 AM):  good idea
macy (10:04:55 AM):  for me, the google pioneers rang out
jake (10:05:19 AM):  okay - first person, steve jobs
lynn (10:05:50 AM):  he was influential many years ago, but i don't think that has lasted
macy (10:05:51 AM):  he has helpd change social behavior quite a bit (similar to google)
melany (10:06:05 AM):  yes there is so much influence caused by apple
melany (10:06:12 AM):  in the way we socialize and use techonology
lynn (10:06:27 AM):  yes
macy (10:06:49 AM):  shall we keep him on the list for the moment?
lynn (10:07:03 AM):  sure
jake (10:07:04 AM):  so there are 2 categories we have to consider when evaluating these people. category one, "largest social and cultural impact" yes? or no?
macy (10:07:15 AM):  sounds good
melany (10:07:17 AM):  that sounds good
jake (10:07:20 AM):  i say yes he fits it
lynn (10:07:49 AM):  as for largest social and cultural impact, i don't think so, but i'd agree to keep him on the list
melany (10:08:01 AM):  i think hes a good one to keep in mind
jake (10:08:11 AM):  ok
jake (10:08:44 AM):  second category: widely known, name is common knowledge
jake (10:08:55 AM):  i say his name is not, but his brand is
melany (10:09:08 AM):  yes
lynn (10:09:13 AM):  yes, i think so too
melany (10:09:14 AM):  apple is everywhere
macy (10:09:18 AM):  true
lynn (10:09:28 AM):  a lot of people know his name simply because he is so wealthy
lynn (10:09:36 AM):  same with bill gates
melany (10:10:10 AM):  yes i believe they fall into a similar category
macy (10:10:34 AM):  i think bill's name is definitely known- at least for "computer stuff" lol
melany (10:10:45 AM):  haha yes
jake (10:10:46 AM):  okay - so he fits the first one better than the second criteria. made an impact but name is not a household name
macy (10:10:58 AM):  the two names are quite similar though
lynn (10:11:17 AM):  he also has to be worlwide known and influential, not just us. and i think he fits that criteria as well
lynn (10:11:26 AM):  (or she)
melany (10:11:56 AM):  thats a good point
melany (10:12:03 AM):  i think worldwide recognition is important
lynn (10:12:50 AM):  how about barack obama, the next on the list?
jake (10:13:00 AM):  so from 1-5 how would we rate steve jobs on the first category
lynn (10:13:12 AM):  is 1 most or least influential?
jake (10:13:17 AM):  yes
melany (10:13:31 AM):  id go with a 3
macy (10:13:41 AM):  1 is most influential?
lynn (10:13:42 AM):  i'd go with a 3 as well
macy (10:14:05 AM):  3- middle of the road
jake (10:14:06 AM):  okay, so 3 it is. for the second criteria?, 1-5
lynn (10:14:16 AM):  wait, is 1 most or least influential?
jake (10:14:21 AM):  least deat
jake (10:14:25 AM):  *least
lynn (10:14:28 AM):  ok
melany (10:14:58 AM):  i feel as if there was so much hype surrounding him during his election and his fight for change, etc.
melany (10:15:05 AM):  but in terms of his actual presidency
melany (10:15:15 AM):  im not sure if he;s as influential as we thought he would be
melany (10:15:17 AM):  yet anyway
jake (10:15:20 AM):  no dear, were talking about steve jobs, second criteria
lynn (10:15:21 AM):  right, i agree
melany (10:15:32 AM):  oh sorry!
lynn (10:15:34 AM):  oh, ok
jake (10:15:40 AM):  1-5
jake (10:15:46 AM):  i say 4
jake (10:15:54 AM):  having a mac is the in thing now
melany (10:16:01 AM):  or an ipod
jake (10:16:09 AM):  it has def impacted our attitudes
macy (10:16:13 AM):  what is the 2nd criteria?
jake (10:16:21 AM):  their name is common knowledge, their contributions in their field have brought great attention to that field or to themselves and have profoundly affected our attitudes
lynn (10:16:36 AM):  i'd say 3. but i still have a pc :)
lynn (10:16:42 AM):  and no ipod
macy (10:16:54 AM):  name common= 3
macy (10:17:00 AM):  contributions= 4
melany (10:17:10 AM):  i agree with macy
lynn (10:17:15 AM):  and worldwide?
lynn (10:17:30 AM):  i would guess a 2 or 3 for that
jake (10:17:42 AM):  we have to come up with one number
jake (10:17:48 AM):  so either 2 3 or 4
macy (10:17:56 AM):  2
lynn (10:18:16 AM):  isn't worlwide a 3rd separate criteria, though?
melany (10:18:37 AM):  2
lynn (10:18:44 AM):  i'd go with 2 as well for contributions
macy (10:19:01 AM):  1= least influential correct?
lynn (10:19:07 AM):  yes, i think so macy
jake (10:19:07 AM):  yes macy
jake (10:19:55 AM):  theres only 2 criterias, they are the 2 paragraphs   lists
lynn (10:20:54 AM):  well, i think it's important to consider them being internationally influential vs. domestically influential is important as well
lynn (10:21:08 AM):  that's a lot of info for the second criteria
macy (10:21:36 AM):  the largest social and cultural impact could mean both natioanl and internl
melany (10:21:52 AM):  thats a good way to analyze it
jake (10:21:56 AM):  she does say worldwide
jake (10:22:08 AM):  so its included in there
lynn (10:22:24 AM):  and contributions aren't, though?
macy (10:22:35 AM):  most of the contendors on this list are american
lynn (10:22:48 AM):  yes, it is very american heavy
jake (10:22:54 AM):  so steve jobs, second criteria
lynn (10:22:54 AM):  but not all have the same international impact
melany (10:22:57 AM):  yes i noticed that as well
macy (10:23:06 AM):  so...i think we just need to see them as "most" influential or not
jake (10:23:15 AM):  okay
jake (10:23:23 AM):  steve jobs, second criteria, influential or not
melany (10:23:26 AM):  yeah some i can definetly see as only american influential
lynn (10:23:31 AM):  me too
jake (10:23:58 AM):  i say influential
melany (10:24:04 AM):  i agree
macy (10:24:06 AM):  agree
jake (10:24:10 AM):  okay
jake (10:24:15 AM):  next one
jake (10:24:16 AM):  obama
lynn (10:24:20 AM):  wait, then what is the number?
lynn (10:24:31 AM):  didn't you want to get one number, jake?
jake (10:24:35 AM):  macy proposed not to do the numbers lynn
lynn (10:24:36 AM):  before moving on?
lynn (10:24:47 AM):  ok, sorry, i must have missed that
macy (10:24:49 AM):  i did?
jake (10:24:52 AM):  were just saying influential or not for both criteria
jake (10:25:02 AM):  macy: so...i think we just need to see them as "most" influential or not
macy (10:25:18 AM):  oh i didnt mean we shouldnt use numbers
lynn (10:25:22 AM):  sorry, i'm confused......
macy (10:25:22 AM):  but whatever works honestly
jake (10:25:23 AM):  i think thats better - narrows it down
macy (10:25:26 AM):  ok
jake (10:25:30 AM):  ya.
jake (10:25:44 AM):  okay - so obama ladies, influential or not?
lynn (10:26:01 AM):  def
lynn (10:26:08 AM):  but not for the past 10 years
jake (10:26:09 AM):  def
macy (10:26:11 AM):  i dont think he has been most inflential throughout the decade
macy (10:26:23 AM):  maybe for this coming decade he will be considered
melany (10:26:25 AM):  yea, considering the decade, i dont think hes influential
lynn (10:26:27 AM):  right
jake (10:26:44 AM):  well i think his impact is very influential eventho he hasnt been around long
jake (10:26:55 AM):  he changed years and years of american history
macy (10:27:20 AM):  what has been his social/cultural influence- he certainly has made history
lynn (10:27:45 AM):  yes, but as far as contributions to his field, that has yet to be determined
jake (10:27:52 AM):  his social influence is that he inspires minorities to think they can do whatever they want in terms of reaching their dreams
jake (10:28:13 AM):  for a black to be president, it serves as inspiration to minorities
macy (10:28:14 AM):  i agree
macy (10:28:45 AM):  i just dont see his contributions influencing the world (yet)
melany (10:29:08 AM):  yeah i agree with jake and lynn
melany (10:29:14 AM):  he is definetly influential socially
melany (10:29:28 AM):  im not sure if his contributions will be heavily influential
melany (10:29:29 AM):  as of yet
melany (10:29:42 AM):  that could certainly change though
lynn (10:29:51 AM):  and he's definitely impacted the world, not just the US
macy (10:29:56 AM):  yes
lynn (10:30:07 AM):  but not more so than others on this list, in my opinio
jake (10:30:17 AM):  ya. he needs a little more time for his influence to be seen worldwide
lynn (10:30:20 AM):  or *because* of others on this list
melany (10:30:46 AM):  yeah i think he needs more time
jake (10:31:23 AM):  so not influential for the first criteria?
melany (10:31:32 AM):  correct
lynn (10:31:48 AM):  i would say influential for the first, not for the second
jake (10:32:11 AM):  i think its the other way lynn
macy (10:32:20 AM):  what is the first and second?
jake (10:32:21 AM):  well actually
lynn (10:32:23 AM):  i don't see it that way
lynn (10:32:28 AM):  yea, i think i'm confused about the criteria
jake (10:32:42 AM):  okay - the 1st one is the 1st paragraph
jake (10:32:50 AM):  the 2nd one is the 2nd paragraph
lynn (10:32:52 AM):  isn't the first social and cultural impact?
jake (10:33:12 AM):  yes correct lynn. thats the 1st one coz its the 1st paragraph
macy (10:33:24 AM):  2nd paragrapg shouldnt be just one criteria
lynn (10:33:29 AM):  i agree with that
lynn (10:33:32 AM):  macy
macy (10:33:39 AM):  name may not be known, but contributions could be Very influential
jake (10:33:45 AM):  okay
melany (10:33:47 AM):  oh then i think that he is influential in the first paragraph i think
jake (10:34:01 AM):  okay
jake (10:34:05 AM):  2nd criteria?
melany (10:34:07 AM):  because of him being the first african american president
melany (10:34:37 AM):  i think not influential
melany (10:34:39 AM):  in the 2nd
lynn (10:34:48 AM):  if 2nd criteria is that his name is well know, then i would say yes
melany (10:34:59 AM):  ohhh i took it as contributions
melany (10:35:01 AM):  this is confusing
lynn (10:35:02 AM):  but if it's contributions to the field, i agree with melany
melany (10:35:02 AM):  haha
lynn (10:35:08 AM):  hehe, yes it is
macy (10:35:13 AM):  very confusing
melany (10:35:14 AM):  theres too much criteria in each paragraph
melany (10:35:29 AM):  for it to be only 2 categories
macy (10:35:32 AM):  can we vote yes or no, as him being Most Influential overall
melany (10:35:36 AM):  but too many categories can get confusing as well
melany (10:35:44 AM):  yeah lets dothat
lynn (10:35:45 AM):  yes, maybe that's a good approach, macy
jake (10:35:54 AM):  okay
macy (10:35:59 AM):  i would have to go with "no"
melany (10:36:03 AM):  no
macy (10:36:05 AM):  but hope he is a yes soon!!!
jake (10:36:07 AM):  okay
jake (10:36:14 AM):  so no for obama. next one
jake (10:36:18 AM):  lady gaga
lynn (10:36:19 AM):  no for me, too
macy (10:36:22 AM):  no no no
lynn (10:36:24 AM):  sorry, that was for obama
lynn (10:36:30 AM):  but a HUGE no for lady gaga
macy (10:36:34 AM):  oh no for both obama and lady
macy (10:36:39 AM):  Lol lynn
lynn (10:36:45 AM):  right
jake (10:36:55 AM):  so wait ladies, before we move on for gaga, since we changed the criterias, what do we say for steve jobs
melany (10:37:04 AM):  i say yes
lynn (10:37:05 AM):  yes
macy (10:37:06 AM):  yes
jake (10:37:08 AM):  okay
lynn (10:37:19 AM):  like lady gaga, i think there are some we can just immediately cross off
jake (10:37:25 AM):  back to gaga. do we have a consensus on lady g?
macy (10:37:26 AM):  agreed
melany (10:37:31 AM):  yes she is definetly an NO
melany (10:37:33 AM):  a NO*
jake (10:37:45 AM):  we can cross off tiger for me
lynn (10:37:50 AM):  me too
lynn (10:37:53 AM):  and j.k. rowling
macy (10:37:56 AM):  tiger no
melany (10:37:57 AM):  yes me too
lynn (10:37:57 AM):  and roger federer
jake (10:38:02 AM):  okay
macy (10:38:02 AM):  jk rowling no
melany (10:38:10 AM):  i dont even know who roger is haha
jake (10:38:22 AM):  okay so rowling is out too
lynn (10:38:28 AM):  right
melany (10:38:30 AM):  yes
jake (10:38:44 AM):  okay.. on to the next one. bin laden?
macy (10:38:55 AM):  roger= tennis player
lynn (10:39:02 AM):  he gets my vote as most influential on this list
lynn (10:39:04 AM):  osama that is
melany (10:39:30 AM):  i def think hes influential
lynn (10:39:31 AM):  i think he's had a greater impact in every respect for the last 10 years worldwide than anybody else.
macy (10:39:41 AM):  osama is a difficult one for me. i say yes, he's helped change attitudes
macy (10:40:38 AM):  but i dont like saying that he alone has made this impact- of course not just 1 person could change to attitude of our whole nation- it is people with his way of thinking
lynn (10:40:41 AM):  he's changed the course of the political, economic and cultural system of the only so-called superpower in the world
lynn (10:41:02 AM):  and he's polarized so many attitudes politically, socially, culturally
lynn (10:41:09 AM):  spiritually
macy (10:41:21 AM):  true
lynn (10:41:23 AM):  right, i agree with that comment macy
lynn (10:41:31 AM):  he has defintely had help
macy (10:41:38 AM):  i really dont like the idea of giving one person all that notoriety
macy (10:41:50 AM):  BUT he has made his name KNOWN
melany (10:41:59 AM):  true
jake (10:42:04 AM):  ya tru
macy (10:42:18 AM):  how about we keep him on the list for now as a yes
macy (10:42:22 AM):  ?
jake (10:42:26 AM):  it has def crippled world economy
melany (10:42:26 AM):  good idea
jake (10:42:29 AM):  ok
lynn (10:42:29 AM):  can we nominate "al-qaeda"
lynn (10:42:30 AM):  ?
macy (10:42:52 AM):  it says "influential person of the past decade" though
lynn (10:43:02 AM):  right, just thought i'd throw that out there
macy (10:43:08 AM):  so has the leader he could very well be named the one for us
lynn (10:43:24 AM):  to answer your question, yes, ,def keep him on the list
jake (10:43:27 AM):  ok
jake (10:43:59 AM):  next on, brin
melany (10:44:19 AM):  very influential
melany (10:44:23 AM):  i did not know them by name
lynn (10:44:26 AM):  have to admit, i don't know those names too well, but i definitely know their product
melany (10:44:32 AM):  but certainly google says everything haha
lynn (10:44:35 AM):  right
macy (10:44:50 AM):  i knew the names only becuase i watched a show on them
macy (10:45:00 AM):  But i do think what they've done is most inflential
macy (10:45:21 AM):  hey, they are more than one person LOL
lynn (10:45:26 AM):  hahahaha
lynn (10:45:30 AM):  true!
jake (10:46:08 AM):  page and brin sorry lol
macy (10:46:12 AM):  i vote yes for these guys
melany (10:46:12 AM):  hahaa
jake (10:46:14 AM):  influential
melany (10:46:14 AM):  me too
jake (10:46:16 AM):  okay
lynn (10:46:17 AM):  yes for me too
jake (10:46:22 AM):  next one, brush
jake (10:46:26 AM):  bush
lynn (10:46:28 AM):  def keep him on the list
macy (10:46:49 AM):  did he change out attitudes socially culturally?
lynn (10:46:52 AM):  although there were many people behind him
macy (10:46:53 AM):  our
lynn (10:47:02 AM):  i think he absolutely did
melany (10:47:17 AM):  yeah id keep him
lynn (10:47:18 AM):  worlwide, too
macy (10:47:21 AM):  ok
jake (10:47:27 AM):  ok
jake (10:47:36 AM):  next one, gates
lynn (10:47:46 AM):  very influential
melany (10:47:48 AM):  if were keeping jobs, id keep him
macy (10:47:55 AM):  he might have been pre 200-2010
macy (10:48:25 AM):  jobs is currently changing the face of technology
lynn (10:48:43 AM):  yea, his impact has kind of faded, but it's still there i think. i heard on npr the other day that some companies are getting ready to go after microsoft again
macy (10:49:02 AM):  didnt he step down?
melany (10:49:05 AM):  i just learned in class that instead of 45 million children dying in africa only 9 million are
melany (10:49:09 AM):  something like that
melany (10:49:15 AM):  because of his vaccine donations
lynn (10:49:25 AM):  he also has the bill gates foundation
macy (10:49:29 AM):  i believe that- i know he is doing great things in his foundation
macy (10:49:43 AM):  maybe that is his influence there instead of through computers these days
lynn (10:49:51 AM):  it's definitely a different business model than bernie madoff
melany (10:50:13 AM):  true
macy (10:50:14 AM):  lol
macy (10:50:29 AM):  maybe bernie should be a contendor (kidding)
lynn (10:50:33 AM):  hehehe
jake (10:50:37 AM):  lol
melany (10:50:44 AM):  haha
jake (10:50:46 AM):  okay so gates is influential?
lynn (10:50:47 AM):  seriously, he's def had an impact
lynn (10:50:49 AM):  yes
jake (10:50:53 AM):  ok
macy (10:50:59 AM):  yes
melany (10:51:14 AM):  so on to the next one?
jake (10:51:17 AM):  ok - winfrey
melany (10:51:19 AM):  oprah?
jake (10:51:30 AM):  influential
macy (10:51:41 AM):  no
macy (10:51:51 AM):  just to a certain group of people- women mainly
lynn (10:51:52 AM):  i'm kind of torn on her
melany (10:52:05 AM):  i'm torn as well
lynn (10:52:28 AM):  but like the impact obama had for minorities, she's had the same for women
lynn (10:52:38 AM):  that's not a perfect comparison, but it is true to some degree
jake (10:52:39 AM):  tru
melany (10:52:48 AM):  i agree
macy (10:52:58 AM):  yea
lynn (10:53:05 AM):  she's also had a worldwide impact with her schools that she's opened up in africa
jake (10:53:13 AM):  so shes influential, but not to the degree that were looking for?
jake (10:53:27 AM):  so therefore, she doesnt make our list?
macy (10:53:37 AM):  i think so
jake (10:53:38 AM):  ok
melany (10:53:40 AM):  ok
macy (10:53:43 AM):  that she doesnt make the worlwide impact
lynn (10:54:57 AM):  we can also nominate people not on this list. anybody have any nominations?
macy (10:55:15 AM):  good question
lynn (10:55:27 AM):  i would almost vote for colin powell or condeleeze rice
lynn (10:55:40 AM):  nominate, i mean
jake (10:56:24 AM):  idk lynn, youd have to ask for that
melany (10:56:31 AM):  i cant think of anyone else
jake (10:56:46 AM):  so so far, we have jobs, page and brin, bush and gates to choose from
macy (10:56:58 AM):  thanks for that jake- good to keep track
lynn (10:57:07 AM):  doesn't it say, "you may pick someone not mentioned here?"
macy (10:57:13 AM):  yes it says that
melany (10:57:16 AM):  yes it does
lynn (10:57:20 AM):  was osama on there, too?
macy (10:57:23 AM):  anyone else have nominations?
jake (10:57:40 AM):  oh right, bin laden is there too
jake (10:58:07 AM):  so again, WITHOUT the nominations, we have: job, page and brin, gates, bush and bin laden
melany (10:58:14 AM):  yupp
lynn (10:58:19 AM):  yes
macy (10:58:29 AM):  yeah
melany (10:58:58 AM):  and lynn, would you like to nominate colin powell and condeleeze rice?
jake (10:59:09 AM):  from this list, who can we eliminate before we nominate
lynn (10:59:27 AM):  yes, why not. they may be knocked right off again, but i think they fit the criteria
lynn (10:59:36 AM):  unless you all think they shouldn't be on there
macy (10:59:36 AM):  i'd take down gates
melany (10:59:54 AM):  i agree we can eliminate gates
jake (11:00:00 AM):  ok
lynn (11:00:03 AM):  i'd agree to take him off, too
lynn (11:00:23 AM):  i would take off the apple guys, too
macy (11:00:34 AM):  ohh i would want them to stay
macy (11:00:37 AM):  :)
macy (11:01:07 AM):  i like the idea of keeping them on there becuase.....
macy (11:01:27 AM):  i think google has changed so much about our culture and social ways-
jake (11:01:46 AM):  ya
lynn (11:01:47 AM):  sorry, i was talking about jobs and apple
lynn (11:01:52 AM):  not the page and brin guys
lynn (11:02:13 AM):  google is more significant to me than apple
jake (11:02:15 AM):  i think between apple and google, id lean to taking jobs off
melany (11:02:23 AM):  i agree
jake (11:02:41 AM):  okay
macy (11:02:41 AM):  agreed
jake (11:02:46 AM):  so apple is out
jake (11:03:00 AM):  anyone else we want to eliminate
melany (11:03:26 AM):  so its between google, bush,. and osama?
jake (11:03:30 AM):  yes
lynn (11:03:50 AM):  between those three, i would take off google
macy (11:03:57 AM):  the way we have google there (the two guys) makes me think that maybe osama bin should really stay on that list- or al queda
melany (11:05:00 AM):  hmmm
macy (11:05:27 AM):  any thoughts?
melany (11:05:30 AM):  i guess id take off google
jake (11:05:46 AM):  ya - i think osama is better than google
macy (11:05:58 AM):  agreed
melany (11:06:00 AM):  because it may not have affected those that did not use computers
jake (11:06:04 AM):  truuuu
lynn (11:06:11 AM):  osama and bush affected even how we board planes nowadays
macy (11:06:12 AM):  nice point melany
lynn (11:06:21 AM):  right, melany
jake (11:06:24 AM):  so osama and bush
macy (11:06:48 AM):  out of them i would have to go with osama...unfortunately
lynn (11:07:06 AM):  i would have to agree, although it was bush who reacted
jake (11:07:14 AM):  hmm, this is a tough one
lynn (11:07:17 AM):  and caused a lot of the polarization
macy (11:07:38 AM):  without the ways of some people in this world, out country would not feel so threatened
lynn (11:07:46 AM):  morally, i don't want to give it to osama
melany (11:08:02 AM):  haha i agree lynn
macy (11:08:10 AM):  and the some people, meaing those who want to bring the usa down in the sense of safety, etc
lynn (11:08:14 AM):  because that's what he wanted is to be the most influential and have people listen to him through these means
jake (11:08:17 AM):  unfortunately, his effect on this nation and to the world will be felt for years to come
melany (11:08:24 AM):  yes
lynn (11:08:46 AM):  but if the US had done nothing, or had taken a different course of action, the world could have been a very different palce
macy (11:08:47 AM):  lynn, i am struggling with that also- not wanting to give him this name of most infliuential
lynn (11:09:14 AM):  this is a tough one
jake (11:09:30 AM):  well, its sad but tru
jake (11:09:50 AM):  he is the most influential, tho negative, to how our society and the world will be
melany (11:10:02 AM):  i agree with jake
macy (11:10:14 AM):  looking at the handout again- osama hits all critera right on the head
melany (11:10:22 AM):  yea he really does
macy (11:10:27 AM):  booo
jake (11:10:34 AM):  it has def mmade our lives for the worse
lynn (11:10:43 AM):  but who's had more cartoons written about him around the world? who's had a shoe thrown at him?
lynn (11:10:51 AM):  because of how he reacted
macy (11:11:06 AM):  and i think prez obama will be able to change our attitudes over this current decade! (wishful thinking of course)
lynn (11:11:20 AM):  let's hope so
jake (11:11:36 AM):  so, do we agree that osama is our top choice without nominations yet?
melany (11:11:48 AM):  yes
jake (11:11:50 AM):  ok
macy (11:11:51 AM):  yeah
lynn (11:11:52 AM):  let me read the criteria again
lynn (11:11:58 AM):  sorry.....
lynn (11:11:59 AM):  one sec
macy (11:12:04 AM):  that's alright
lynn (11:13:06 AM):  geez, contributions to the field? field of terrorism?
lynn (11:13:08 AM):  yikes
jake (11:13:11 AM):  hahahha
lynn (11:13:16 AM):  i would have to agree, unfortunately
melany (11:13:34 AM):  hahha
melany (11:13:37 AM):  yea sad but true
macy (11:13:55 AM):  yeah
jake (11:14:35 AM):  so any nominations?
lynn (11:14:39 AM):  i'm torn between nominating al-qaeda
jake (11:14:40 AM):  we have 15 minutes
lynn (11:14:43 AM):  if we can do that
lynn (11:14:47 AM):  rather than osama
lynn (11:14:51 AM):  somebody else suggested that too
macy (11:15:03 AM):  "either from this list or you may pick someone not mentioned here."
lynn (11:15:04 AM):  he really did what he did in their name
macy (11:15:19 AM):  what lynn?
lynn (11:15:32 AM):  osama, he carried out his acts in the name of al-qaeda
macy (11:15:38 AM):  ah- agreed
lynn (11:15:41 AM):  well, of islam also
macy (11:16:18 AM):  i cant think of anyone to nominate
melany (11:16:28 AM):  me either
jake (11:16:29 AM):  so do we want al-q instead of osama?
macy (11:16:33 AM):  can anything think of some houselhold names?
lynn (11:16:50 AM):  no, anybody else just seems trite after osama bin laden
jake (11:16:56 AM):  ok
lynn (11:17:08 AM):  unless people have any thoughts about al-qaeda
jake (11:17:16 AM):  so osama is our choice ladies?
macy (11:17:22 AM):  yes
melany (11:17:22 AM):  i think so
melany (11:17:24 AM):  yes
jake (11:17:32 AM):  sadly but yes
macy (11:17:55 AM):  at least we had it all thought out
macy (11:18:03 AM):  we tried considering all the others
jake (11:18:08 AM):  ya
lynn (11:18:40 AM):  well, ok, i guess we didn't really ever consider lady gaga :)
macy (11:18:48 AM):  hahaha
melany (11:18:55 AM):  yeah she was clearly a NO
macy (11:18:56 AM):  or tiger
macy (11:18:59 AM):  lol
melany (11:19:00 AM):  ugh
melany (11:19:02 AM):  what a disgrace
lynn (11:19:06 AM):  really
macy (11:19:24 AM):  i'm surprised no one mentioned michael jackson
lynn (11:19:33 AM):  oh yeah, that would have been interesting to discuss
macy (11:19:36 AM):  his name pops up a lot
lynn (11:19:45 AM):  though i guess he was more in the 90s
macy (11:19:51 AM):  yeah
melany (11:19:53 AM):  oh yeaaa
lynn (11:20:05 AM):  or the founder of twitter
macy (11:20:17 AM):  maybe the jonas brothers for 2000-2010 lol
jake (11:20:20 AM):  hahahah
jake (11:20:24 AM):  jonas brothersss
jake (11:20:26 AM):  miley cyrusss
macy (11:20:35 AM):  facebook inventor
jake (11:20:40 AM):  yaaaa
jake (11:20:43 AM):  facebook
lynn (11:20:47 AM):  that would have been a great one
melany (11:20:50 AM):  oh wow fb inventor
macy (11:20:56 AM):  i think google is much bigger than fb though honestly
melany (11:20:57 AM):  thats a good one
melany (11:20:59 AM):  oh yes
lynn (11:21:02 AM):  i prob still would have voted for osama though
melany (11:21:02 AM):  more used
macy (11:21:09 AM):  yeah lynn
jake (11:21:13 AM):  ya coz not everyone has facebook
macy (11:21:17 AM):  right
lynn (11:21:17 AM):  right
melany (11:22:11 AM):  yes of course
lynn (11:22:52 AM):  i just saw lady gaga's video for the first time ever last night
lynn (11:23:00 AM):  "telephone", i think it was

jake (11:23:04 AM):  with beyonce
macy (11:23:05 AM):  a video? whats that
macy (11:23:07 AM):  lol
lynn (11:23:10 AM):  haha
macy (11:23:16 AM):  how was it?
lynn (11:23:27 AM):  she's pretty outrageous
jake (11:23:31 AM):  shes def very creative and a genius. she purposely dresses crazy coz it attacts media attentioon
lynn (11:23:34 AM):  but i can see how she is compared to madonna
jake (11:23:36 AM):  and she gets money for it
macy (11:23:56 AM):  i dont know her at all- i saw madonne on the marriage ref show the other day though
lynn (11:24:12 AM):  how was it?
macy (11:24:25 AM):  she was pretty funny
melany (11:24:29 AM):  i heard its amazing haha
macy (11:24:37 AM):  but the show is pretty bad for a show
lynn (11:25:24 AM):  haven't ever seen it
melany (11:25:38 AM):  shes just bizarre
melany (11:25:48 AM):  but is extremely successful at creating hit songs
lynn (11:25:52 AM):  yes
jake (11:26:31 AM):  i wonder if she writes her songs tho - or has a ghost writer
melany (11:26:40 AM):  yeah im unsure of that
lynn (11:27:01 AM):  i think she's written a few of her own
lynn (11:27:14 AM):  but not her big ones, ,like "Like a Virgin", etc...
macy (11:27:33 AM):  i hope she wrote the older ones which were hits- hadnt thought of that
melany (11:27:33 AM):  it's been nice chatting with you all during this experience :)
lynn (11:27:45 AM):  you too, melany
macy (11:28:00 AM):  you too

melany (11:29:40 AM):  bye everyone! yes, osama
moderator (11:29:43 AM):  thank you all, I will send out a closing email tomorrow!
jake (11:29:53 AM):  k thank you

jeremy (0:00:09.3):  thanks.
rebecca (0:00:27.9):  a, and meg has been tasked to be our leader today. so she will be kind of facilitating, making sure that we are on track. making sure that the time has been kept.
caroline (0:05:22.5):  do you have extra pens?
meg (0:05:24.5):  these don't work.
caroline (0:05:25.5):  yeah. no.
jeremy (0:05:25.6):  yeah.
david (0:05:26.8):  thank you for asking that.
caroline (0:05:27.1):  yeah.
david (0:05:31.0):  for some reason they (???) pen.
david (0:06:03.6):  great. thanks.
meg (0:06:04.7):  thank you.
jeremy (0:06:06.4):  thanks.
meg (0:14:45.3):  okay. well, since it's just about 4:30, why don't we get started. we can go through these one by one or we can talk about the guys--the ones you guys have already read--in--from--from what we did online before. it's a little easier i think to go through them one by one, rule them out that way. but, i mean, it's up to you. anybody who has an input. feel free to jump in.
barney (0:14:54.1):  well, i only really saw one that didn't really seem to have much to offer on rosie mann. i didn't really see anything too impressive about her.
meg (0:14:54.7):  yeah.
caroline (0:14:54.7):  yeah.
barney (0:14:58.2):  the others were, i s--saw some impressive things about.
caroline (0:14:58.7):  oh.
barney (0:14:59.9):  with her, umm.
meg (0:15:06.4):  well, she doesn't meet the requirement for education, 'cause they ask for a bachelor's degree. so i agree with you.
vicky (0:15:20.6):  right. and she has no related experience. umm, she probably has charisma. it looks like she was--she played several leads, which would be good, but she's--doesn't seem qualified for the job. maybe to work underneath the job we're hiring for, but.
meg (0:15:20.7):  yeah.
vicky (0:15:22.2):  not the job itself.
caroline (0:15:37.4):  i agree with like what she said about having theater experience. i think that adds charisma and creativity and i feel like the only other thing she really possessed that was an asset was computer skills. but other than that, i don't think that she had much though to make her qualified.
jeremy (0:15:38.4):  yeah
meg (0:15:47.8):  as far as resumes go, i like her qualification summary. it's out there. i don't know, just--thought that was kinda funny.
jeremy (0:15:51.8):  i assume we--are we ruling that one out then?
meg (0:15:53.9):  yep. all in favor say i.
caroline (0:15:54.3):  i.
jeremy (0:15:54.8):  i
barney (0:15:55.5):  okay.
caroline (0:15:57.0):  bye, rosie.
meg (0:16:19.1):  so no rosie. all right. how 'bout sally next? she's got a ba in administration, which is good. and a pretty high gpa, which is also important. and she mentions all three of the p.c. skills that are mentioned on the job description. so also a plus.
barney (0:16:32.8):  i also like how she had, umm, stress management 'cause i cannot imagine how dealing with the press would be a pretty stressful job. and she also had lots of, umm, computer skills, it looks like. she knows how to make a web page. she knows html.
meg (0:16:33.5):  yeah.
caroline (0:16:34.0):  uh huh.
david (0:16:34.9):  humm.
david (0:16:35.6):  or, yeah. those are all pluses for sure, like the, umm, the html. umm, although, it's not a required skill, it's clearly mentioned in--as--as part of like the job description that...
meg (0:16:46.6):  uh huh.
david (0:16:46.9):  ...you're gonna be, umm, designing some web pages. umm, her--her like major does, a, fit, but on the other hand, it's like a broad--it's pretty inclusive in terms of these, a...
meg (0:16:58.0):  yeah
david (0:17:03.3):  so as long as it's not too, a, too di--you know, different. umm...
meg (0:17:08.4):  she also really doesn't have any work experience that's like directly related.
rebecca (0:17:08.6):  yeah. looks like she like...
jeremy (0:17:09.4):  yeah, that's--that's
caroline (0:17:14.1):  kind of knows something, but just some like very like basic like entry level.
meg (0:17:14.9):  yeah.
david (0:17:34.1):  yeah, like the third bullet on employment isn't real specific, umm, in addition to like stress management media--meditation, umm, that could be helpful in any job setting probably. but it--it doesn't really describe how she's like certified in this area. how is this gonna contribute, i guess.
meg (0:17:34.7):  yeah.
david (0:17:35.7):  umm.
meg (0:17:41.7):  and then she was a writer for her yearbook, but i don't know if that really qualifies her to write...
david (0:17:42.3):  right.
meg (0:17:44.6):  a, press releases.
david (0:17:45.1):  yeah. there's also no dates for the employment. so it could have been a very short period or the entire length of her...
meg (0:17:50.9):  yeah.
david (0:18:00.2):  ...her undergraduate career there, so. umm, strong gpa is--is a (attractive though).
meg (0:18:00.5):  yeah.
barney (0:18:04.6):  i believe she has the strongest of all the gpas yet
david (0:18:16.1):  right. i mean, this one individual, like he did win a couple scholarships, but it doesn't say what his gpa is, so we really want to (get/guess) mark (is that the ??).
meg (0:18:16.8):  uh huh.
david (0:18:18.1):  the governor's state scholarship
vicky (0:18:18.3):  yeah.
david (0:18:29.5):  umm, we would have to kind of look those up to see what they--like the art competition, this does look for some creativity in a job, but like a studio art. that could be really...
barney (0:18:32.0):  well, it is a marketing campaign.
jeremy (0:18:32.3):  right.
barney (0:18:33.4):  which would involve making a...
meg (0:18:33.7):  (???/kids.)
barney (0:18:39.4):  ...leaflets and stuff and that would, umm, require some artistic skills. that to me was one of the biggest things that he had.
rebecca (0:18:42.7):  and he also has experience with writing press releases
caroline (0:18:43.0):  uh huh.
meg (0:18:43.6):  yeah.
david (0:18:43.8):  yeah.
rebecca (0:18:44.1):  that is big.
meg (0:18:45.5):  that's definite plus.
david (0:18:53.5):  yeah, and he has au--a--a pretty good amount of--it's eight months of work experience and, umm, although he was an intern...
meg (0:18:54.8):  he still learned...
david (0:18:59.3):  he wasn't like a student employee. so i don't know, it's kind of like almost professional...
meg (0:19:00.1):  yeah.
david (0:19:02.3):  ...experience, i like that.
meg (0:19:04.5):  still learn a lot doing internships though.
david (0:19:04.7):  yeah.
meg (0:19:11.2):  and he was a res hall--or resident assistant, so he knows how to manage things.
caroline (0:19:13.8):  i think it gives 'em interpersonal skills too.
meg (0:19:14.2):  yeah.
caroline (0:19:15.3):  for dealing with that many people.
meg (0:19:16.4):  definitely.
rebecca (0:19:23.5):  just like with developing like the programs for his residents or whatever, you could say it would help with managing the special events for (???).
meg (0:19:24.3):  yeah.
david (0:19:41.3):  yeah. it doesn't list like html skills, but, umm, that's also not explicitly mentioned in the job description. and if we believe that he is truly a motivated self-starter with the hope could grasp issues that--that shouldn't really exclude him, umm...
meg (0:19:41.3):  yeah.
david (0:19:47.0):  but on the other hand, sally, i guess she has definitely some--maintain office web site.
caroline (0:19:47.7):  uh huh.
david (0:19:48.0):  so that could be really for sure...
barney (0:19:50.6):  well...
david (0:19:50.7):  ...asking (???)...
rebecca (0:19:51.5):  but that's still like generally saying that she posted updated content...
david (0:19:54.3):  ...and used that...
rebecca (0:19:57.5):  ...it could just be that she like just plugs in like whatever people give her.
meg (0:19:58.0):  yeah.
rebecca (0:20:00.1):  so you don't really know what that means.
vicky (0:20:15.8):  considering that she has no experience and that the only skill that she's mentioning isn't like a high level skill, it's not very hard to keep a web site updated. especially with the software programs they have now. i think at least her compared to mark, i would say that she's not a strong candidate. umm..
barney (0:20:16.5):  but...
vicky (0:20:20.0):  ... that she has no experience that's directly related to it really hurts her.
barney (0:20:31.3):  to me, the biggest weakness in mark is he--he was a psychology major, which is a nontechical degree. so, umm, he has people skills, but that psych--umm, he could very well have no computer skills at all besides, umm, ???...
meg (0:20:31.8):  but...
david (0:20:32.3):  yeah, but...
meg (0:20:35.6):  he could be io psych, which is industrial organizational.
david (0:20:36.3):  yeah, on the other hand...
meg (0:20:37.3):  so it doesn't say what...
david (0:20:59.6):  this is--this is business administration. it's not, a, chemistry. i mean, i think the psychology degree's--say, for example, he wa--he was a 4.0 and he did, you know, all these social science things like--like we're doing here now. so, umm, because like this is such a inclusive list here, i feel like it meshes pretty well.
barney (0:21:03.5):  but, of course, he didn't list a gpa, which would imply it probably wasn't very high.
vicky (0:21:04.1):  that--i did...
david (0:21:04.8):  yeah, but i...
vicky (0:21:05.3):  ...notice that.
david (0:21:22.4):  it--it implies that, but we would be--we would be guessing there. we would be speculating for sure. just like where she doesn't--her web site, a, it's a pretty, i feel like a reasonable conclusion that to think that, since she doesn't--wasn't real specific. we're--we're talking about her web skills, if they're pretty minimal. a...
meg (0:21:22.8):  yeah.
david (0:21:44.1):  on the other hand, they could be really sophisticated i guess too. umm, but likely she--i mean, i--i going back to your point about, umm, the gpa, but i don't really know how, a, like traditional that is to list your gpa. probably the closer you are, the more recent you are from graduating college, the more your gpa is on your resume, but.
barney (0:21:46.8):  december 2009, you know, that was only two months ago, so.
caroline (0:21:54.2):  but he also has scholarships listed an--more than one, as well as the dean's list two semesters. so i feel like that must correlate with something.
vicky (0:21:55.0):  umm.
meg (0:21:58.8):  yeah, if he's gotten the dean's list for two semesters that means he had to have at least a 3.5...
caroline (0:21:59.9):  ???
meg (0:22:00.9):  ...for those two semesters.
david (0:22:07.3):  yeah. i mean, based on the information we have, it makes it difficult 'cause ideally we could just, a, ask 'em.
meg (0:22:08.0):  yeah.
barney (0:22:08.8):  yes.
caroline (0:22:28.8):  well, i like something else that he had too, which was under the highlights of qualifications. and where it talks about maintaining a view of the big picture. i think that's something that is very important to just maintain control of a job that has a lot of tasks that are involved in it. so i like that a lot.
vicky (0:22:28.9):  yeah.
barney (0:22:39.9):  but, of course, anyone can just say anything there. i mean, a lot of people just say whatever sounds good on those things. i mean, he doesn't really say what that means. he could just be a good writer and know what people wanna hear.
meg (0:22:40.7):  but...
rebecca (0:22:41.1):  he could write that...
barney (0:22:41.3):  that's important to this job.
meg (0:22:41.8):  ...that's a good skill.
caroline (0:22:43.0):  yeah.
barney (0:22:43.4):  yeah. it's really good.
meg (0:23:01.1):  and he, like--i--going back to the points of like the responsibilities, he's gotta, umm, manage the special events and does that with res hall stuff. where, i mean, sally was a camp counselor, so it's like two different sides of the same coin.
david (0:23:02.2):  yeah. 'cause we are talking, umm, unless he'd like to quantify is good, because we get in a sense that sixty residents, that's quite a bit. and they have more, a, maybe like, that's more challenging maybe in a different way than--than children five to ten.
caroline (0:23:19.6):  uh huh.
david (0:23:20.3):  a little different needs.
meg (0:23:32.3):  but the other thing is, is that he's gonna be working --er, well, whoever we choose, is gonna be working with peers and, i mean, sally's working with children, whereas, mark's working with college age people.
caroline (0:23:32.6):  uh huh.
meg (0:23:41.1):  so, i mean, he has to have some sort of--not just like the authority age, but like also like charisma to go along with the...
caroline (0:23:43.7):  i think that's a good point.
barney (0:23:52.3):  and sally only has html which prob--if she only lists that, that means she probably is not that sophis--sophisticated and, umm, that really isn't that hard to pick up html.
meg (0:23:57.4):  yeah. so should we rule out sally? yes?
vicky (0:23:57.9):  i say i.
meg (0:23:58.8):  yes.
meg (0:24:09.2):  all right. who's next? jacob?
jeremy (0:24:26.7):  yeah. jacob was my personal favorite. out of like all the other resumes, they seemed kind of bland to me, but i really like how he has all this a, this--all these people skills listed. i mean, what i got from just glancing over the job description was they want someone to really rep their company. they want them to be face...
meg (0:24:27.6):  yeah.
jeremy (0:24:41.9):  ...and this is like a young kid, he was in a fraternity, did all this, a, he--all this, a, like, a--a events and, umm, shows that he p--and so he was pretty much, a, the one i liked the best. and he had those computer skills.
meg (0:24:42.2):  yeah. he was ???...
jeremy (0:24:42.9):  ??? at some point
meg (0:24:56.7):  computer skills they asked for. whereas like, sorry, mark doesn't list, a, power point. i mean, which isn't really hard, but, i mean i think if they're asking for it, you should at least tell 'em that you know how to do it.
jeremy (0:25:00.3):  yeah. i mean, this is word, word and excel for mark.
rebecca (0:25:01.3):  it looks like he doesn't...
david (0:25:01.4):  (???).
rebecca (0:25:09.1):  ...have maybe a lot of like professional experience, but what he did do, he like was very involved with.
caroline (0:25:09.8):  yeah.
rebecca (0:25:16.6):  like he can pull, you know, things from cl--class and like school, umm, organizations.
meg (0:25:29.1):  and i don't know if i necessarily like his work experience compared to mark, because mark was managing people. whereas, jacob's a waiter slash host.
rebecca (0:25:29.9):  but he's..
meg (0:25:31.4):  it's not an easy job, but.
rebecca (0:25:40.5):  he did also just graduate, so you could say that he didn't have time to have a job maybe while he was at school, but he was very involved in school while he was there.
meg (0:25:40.8):  yeah.
rebecca (0:25:41.4):  so it kind a.
vicky (0:25:58.2):  i think the important thing here is that we're looking for someone who's going to be a team leader, not just on the team. and to jump in only having experience as a waiter works against him. he--i--i really agree with jeremy that he does have the most effective resume, but i think he's also the only one who had a typo on it.
meg (0:25:58.3):  he had a typo?
vicky (0:26:00.8):  and i'm nitpicky about that. he did. umm...
meg (0:26:01.0):  oooh, where?
vicky (0:26:10.2):  underneath the first section, objective, train and management staff. it's little, but it's important and if this is his resume and he's got a typo on it...
meg (0:26:10.9):  oh, yeah, that's....
vicky (0:26:12.7):  ...is he gonna have typos on the press releases?
meg (0:26:13.1):  that would be a negative.
barney (0:26:18.5):  yeah. that's not even grammat--go to lead and train and management. a...
vicky (0:26:19.2):  team.
barney (0:26:22.5):  that's does--it's not even grammatical, i don't think. train and manage staff, right?
vicky (0:26:22.6):  it was probably just...
david (0:26:23.4):  and train
vicky (0:26:29.3):  ...a miss click, but he didn't read over it before submitting it, which isn't very professional of him.
meg (0:26:29.8):  yeah.
david (0:26:29.9):  yeah. that's too bad because i think he's actually a really strong candiate...
vicky (0:26:33.5):  yes.
david (0:26:33.5):  ...otherwise. umm, i mean, if it's...
meg (0:26:37.2):  i mean, he does list his gpa.
david (0:26:54.9):  it depends on how--how much this job will involve like, umm, working with, a, people for sure. and some of it is like behind the scenes though action. not all of it is, a, like a lot of it is a the press releases, the writing, the, a, internet and that type of...
barney (0:26:55.3):  but a...
david (0:26:55.4):  ??? aggressive...
meg (0:26:58.7):  he's writing and he's got typo on his resume. i mean, how--what's.
barney (0:26:58.8):  but to me, they--i really like hi--i really liked his major. he's public relations...
jeremy (0:27:02.6):  oh, yeah.
caroline (0:27:02.9):  yeah.
barney (0:27:03.5):  ...marketing minor and communication. that to me was probably one of the strongest majors...
david (0:27:07.4):  right.
barney (0:27:13.3):  ...for the job. i don't know how much involves business administration, how much communications, but i thought that was very strong.
david (0:27:24.1):  yeah. plus, his--the skills too here it's listed each of these points. you know, so, umm, otherwi--like if it weren't for--weren't for the a typo.
rebecca (0:27:24.6):  umm.
david (0:27:28.3):  i think he'd be a really strong candidate for this particular job.
vicky (0:27:32.2):  he seems strong, but not perfect. so maybe we could keep him as a maybe.
caroline (0:27:32.6):  yeah.
meg (0:27:34.1):  and come back once we've gone through everything.
barney (0:27:34.2):  all right.
meg (0:27:48.7):  he also does the organizing for the special events. he did the talent show and the sales strategy for--or sales presentation strategy for his fraternity car show. so, i--i think those are both pluses.
vicky (0:27:48.8):  uh huh.
caroline (0:27:49.6):  uh huh.
barney (0:27:56.5):  but, for example, i mean he raised four hundred dollars, which really isn't that much. so you don't really know how good he was at that. just that he attempted it.
meg (0:27:57.2):  yeah.
rebecca (0:28:06.0):  well, but that he does have experience with events, event planning or whatever. which is more than any of the other people do, so.
meg (0:28:12.2):  he also did the informal brochure, which is like part of the press release aspect of it.
vicky (0:28:12.4):  umm.
david (0:28:20.9):  yeah. you could also point out too that it depends who he raised the money from. if he was raising it from his fellow, a, peers, it's probably a lot of money. 'cause, umm.
meg (0:28:21.9):  yeah.
david (0:28:27.0):  um--many students aren't really interested in contributing a whole lot. whereas, some people in the older demographic are...
jeremy (0:28:27.4):  humpf.
david (0:28:34.5):  you know, that would be like a real pale in comparison, but this is, a, could be--maybe he's really talented at it, you know, umm.
caroline (0:29:04.5):  i think he did a lot ta, umm, supplement his formal education outside of just his classes and i think that that was a really good thing. that--i just from the advertising and the brochure, the raising money, organizing events, i just feel like he had--he sought out a lot in the fraternity too to, umm, to supplement everything that he was doing. it seems like he has a genuine interest in what he's doing.
vicky (0:29:12.5):  although, that did effect his schoolwork, because he has one of the lower gpas. he has a 3.3 versus 3.6, 3.8, which isn't...
meg (0:29:12.8):  well, that's his end major gpa, but...
caroline (0:29:14.5):  but overall 3.6...
meg (0:29:15.5):  ...his overall's a little higher.
vicky (0:29:16.4):  well the end major's what we're concerned with though. we don't really care about what other classes he took...
caroline (0:29:21.4):  well, we don't...
barney (0:29:21.6):  ???
caroline (0:29:22.2):  ...you can't compare it to the other ones.
david (0:29:22.9):  plus, this isn't really a job i feel like that gpa is like really crucial unless it's like below three. umm, it's like a type of job where like...
caroline (0:29:31.5):  umm.
david (0:29:33.9):  ...being really high in like a social...
jeremy (0:29:34.8):  yeah.
david (0:29:36.3):  ...(???) like working with people...
caroline (0:29:36.6):  right.
david (0:29:40.7):  that is like paramount. umm, gpa is...
meg (0:29:41.3):  i do think education's...
david (0:29:41.9):  ...is adequate.
meg (0:29:49.5):  ...important though, because he's not gonna learn like, umpf, he's not gonna learn to just fix his typos if he's like got.
david (0:29:53.1):  right. for sure you need a, a, i think a bachelor's degree just 'cause it's so...
meg (0:29:53.5):  yeah.
david (0:30:17.5):  ...incredibly common, but, umm, umm, and accesible to most people in your--'cause in your--'cause assuming, fortunately, but. see the problem with a typo is that's such a, umm, our criticism is kinda of very, umm, it's not very substantive critism. it's like, you know, we're gonna--. umm, we assume, maybe, if you were to hire him that he was gonna be more careful on---on the press releases, but i--a.
meg (0:30:17.9):  yeah, but i mean, your resume's really important too. that's how you get your job.
david (0:30:20.9):  it is for sure.
barney (0:30:22.0):  but i didn't even really notice it until she brought it up. i would if...
meg (0:30:25.3):  i didn't either, but now that i see it...
vicky (0:30:27.0):  it wouldn't...
meg (0:30:27.0):  ...it's glaring at me.
vicky (0:30:43.8):  ...be a huge deal, but considering that creating press releases is going to be a large part of his duties, umm, i would argue that you're more careful on your resume and your cover letter than you would be just doing the 99th of 100 tasks that you've been doing for the same company.
meg (0:30:44.3):  yeah.
vicky (0:30:53.7):  i think you'd be more careful when you really have something to lose if you don't do well compared to when you're comfortable and in your job and in the grind.
meg (0:30:56.7):  so why don't we keep both mark and jacob as...
jeremy (0:30:56.9):  yeah.
meg (0:31:00.0):  ...like potential candidates. talk about pamela.
caroline (0:31:05.5):  i thought she was okay.
meg (0:31:06.3):  yeah.
barney (0:31:17.2):  i didn't like how her internship only lasted a few months, so it wasn't that much experience. i mean, it was good what she did, how she presented product, that was really good experience, but it would have been nice if it was a little bit longer.
caroline (0:31:19.7):  but not all internships are that long.
meg (0:31:22.0):  yeah. it's looks like it's just a summer internship.
david (0:31:26.2):  and it's very finance and accounting related too.
meg (0:31:26.7):  yeah.
david (0:31:29.1):  a, it's not really marketing, ummm.
meg (0:31:30.7):  but she does present at the trade shows.
david (0:31:37.8):  yeah. that's what--that's why the--this was put in there i think to make it (???) yeah.
jeremy (0:31:42.7):  other than that, i don't see too many people--other people skills.
meg (0:31:43.5):  any leadership (???).
jeremy (0:31:44.5):  ra.
barney (0:31:46.6):  team leadership training courses on the bottom.
caroline (0:31:47.0):  uh huh.
vicky (0:31:48.0):  umm.
barney (0:31:50.6):  completed that, dorm resident assistant, that requires people skills.
meg (0:31:51.1):  yeah.
david (0:31:51.6):  yeah.
caroline (0:31:52.4):  definitely.
barney (0:31:56.9):  and most likely treasurer, i don't know exactly what's involved in that job, but i'd assume there'd be some.
jeremy (0:32:07.0):  i think it's one thing to deal with your peers, like kids your age. but then when you--with jacob, where he's dealing with other people, not just students. i think it's different in my eyes.
david (0:32:56.9):  yeah. we're not, umm, i don't know, maybe we could say that like jacob learns quickly and he has--he has the html, which, umm, maybe you could say like is--is, a, easy to--to pick up, but for someone who has like very little interest in--in learning it, or who, a, struggles with that. i think it would be like pretty insurmountable obstacle, but possibly. umm, 'cause this is just like treasurer. this is just a very finance and accounting, umm, i mean, she might be like smarter than jacob, but she's not a very good--as a better match. she's not a good--good of match for the job. i don't think.
meg (0:33:06.7):  i don't know. she's also, i mean, the dorm room assistant, like i think that's a good thing, 'cause we said that was good for mark too.
david (0:33:07.4):  it is good.
meg (0:33:19.0):  so, i mean, that shows people skills and management skills, because you have to be able to like kind of organize things and keep people in line. so that's one side of it.
rebecca (0:33:22.0):  but she doesn't really seem to have the creative side at all.
caroline (0:33:22.9):  yeah. i was just gonna say that.
jeremy (0:33:36.8):  yeah. i was kinda of hoping to see more like you could say you're an ra, but you can just sit in your room and like, a, deal with like academ--or, a, a, like judicial problems with your--with your, a, residents. but she didn't really, a, say that too much about like what programs they hosted.
caroline (0:33:37.1):  uh huh.
jeremy (0:33:43.5):  or like what things they did in their common rooms or something. so ra, what--to what depth?
barney (0:33:47.7):  to me, the only thing that she has is that presented product at trade shows. that was a huge thing, but that was the only thing i saw that was impressive.
rebecca (0:34:01.3):  and even that--that could you could say that that's just like sales, which isn't really something that--i don't know.
meg (0:34:12.6):  okay. everyone in favor of pamela say no. i--i'm against her, so.
jeremy (0:34:13.6):  yeah. take her out.↓
caroline (0:34:13.6):  yeah.
meg (0:34:35.6):  ??? against her. all right. i said that all backwards, but. so it's jacob versus mark. da da da. all right. let's go through the pluses of jacob and the minuses. he's got the typo. that's minus. but he has a ba in communications.
barney (0:34:37.0):  and public relations and marketing.
jeremy (0:34:38.0):  yeah.
vicky (0:34:50.1):  and he has probably the most persuasive, umm, resume. he is directly, a, umm, addressing things that the job description does.
meg (0:34:50.7):  yeah.
vicky (0:34:56.8):  which is just a persuasive writing technique and he's the only one really showing that and hitting every point.
barney (0:35:00.5):  yeah. and he also lists his gpa, which is a big thing for me.
caroline (0:35:03.5):  umm, i would say he seems to be really motivated, umm, just from the amount of stuff that he's done and, umm, earning 50 percent of educational expenses. it just seems like he, i don't know, is motivated...
meg (0:35:16.4):  so it's a plus?
caroline (0:35:17.2):  yeah.
jeremy (0:35:17.5):  yeah.
barney (0:35:19.1):  it means he probably could have even done better if he didn't have--if he wasn't working all the time.
caroline (0:35:23.4):  right. it seems like he's handling a lot.
meg (0:35:33.1):  but his work experience is only in the summers.
barney (0:35:35.3):  and i--i personally--i personally like wait staff because, umm, that mean--and--and hosts, because this means he's working with people. he's interacting with and people, talking to them.
rebecca (0:35:42.8):  and it's stressful.
jeremy (0:35:44.7):  absolutely. it's tough, so.
david (0:35:54.8):  yeah. i mean, the problem with that too is--is we see--or we focus on--only on jacob right now, 'cause we see like comparable, a...
meg (0:35:56.3):  yeah.
david (0:35:57.1):  skills with mark.
meg (0:35:59.6):  i mean, we can go both, back and forth.
barney (0:36:02.1):  and he also has photoshop too.
david (0:36:03.0):  yeah, that was big.
meg (0:36:03.5):  yeah.
caroline (0:36:03.9):  uh huh.
barney (0:36:07.2):  but, of course, it depends how good he is in photoshop, so.
meg (0:36:17.1):  yeah. i don't know, i don't think the wait staff is really on his side, though.
jeremy (0:36:24.4):  what, that he didn't like, project himself more into taking a better job? or a think about that.
meg (0:36:24.6):  well, he doesn't have the management experience that mark has. he doesn't have--and in terms of management, i mean like managing...
jeremy (0:36:30.6):  management.
meg (0:36:31.1):  ...people.
jeremy (0:36:31.4):  okay.
meg (0:36:33.0):  i mean, he's got the management training. but that's really i mean, he's got manangement training by organizing a talent show. i don't know if that's really--that's a plus for the special events, but not--he doesn't..
caroline (0:37:05.3):  well, i think it depends on what the talent show is. like if it was a talent show in like a dorm, i think that's one thing. and if it was like a talent show that was in the pack, and he organized like a big, like, you know, like gala surrounding it or something. i could go either way i feel like too.
meg (0:37:07.4):  he says it's for the semester at sea.
david (0:37:09.9):  yeah. we know for sure he has...
meg (0:37:10.3):  so.
david (0:37:12.8):  ...like power point skills.
meg (0:37:13.3):  yeah.
jeremy (0:37:26.4):  like with the html skills, isn't say what he used them for as like, but still his computer skills are a little, umm, deeper maybe more than--than mark.
barney (0:37:34.0):  yeah. the two hardest things to pick up, i would say, would probably be photoshop and maybe power point and, umm, he's got 'em and mark doesn't really.
barney (0:37:35.5):  word and excel are really easy.
david (0:37:36.0):  i think i disagree with that, because i think photoshop is...
meg (0:37:37.2):  yeah, i actually really disagree with that.
david (0:37:48.0):  ...is quite, a, like simple in comparison to, a, html, which is really dynamic and allows for incredible range of abilities.
david (0:37:48.8):  umm.
david (0:37:49.0):  'cause you can have like really good web pages...
rebecca (0:37:51.1):  but he has...
david (0:37:51.6):  all the way down to, a...
caroline (0:37:53.1):  plus, there's...
rebecca (0:37:53.8):  he has both of them, though.
barney (0:37:54.4):  i guess it depends how good you are.
rebecca (0:37:54.8):  just mark that doesn't (???) it.
jeremy (0:37:56.0):  yeah.
meg (0:37:56.2):  there's online guides for like all of this stuff. so there's easy access to web ???)...
barney (0:38:01.0):  oh, yeah, for sure...
meg (0:38:06.1):  if you don't have it already. and that's like the one thing that makes me like wonder if ...
david (0:38:29.5):  yeah, but like photoshop for me is not like the tipping point. i mean, umm, i would expect that mark with the intellect he has here, could easily conquer photoshop with html for certain that's yeah. it's just we don't know, but for photoshop we can be certain he--he knows photoshop.
meg (0:38:32.4):  but mark's...
david (0:38:32.9):  a (???)...
meg (0:38:36.0):  ...it seems like mark has more writing experience.
rebecca (0:38:36.7):  but he also has the...
david (0:38:37.1):  yeah. he (???)...
rebecca (0:38:40.8):  ... the art award. so he must be somewhat creative, but.
meg (0:38:41.0):  yeah.
david (0:38:43.1):  right. yeah. mark has--has...
jeremy (0:38:43.9):  humpf.
david (0:38:45.3):  ...superior writing experience.
caroline (0:38:45.9):  uh huh.
david (0:39:07.9):  i think definitely. yeah. i mean, it would be--'cause that's eight months, that internship, umm, it'd be nice if--if he like was, you know, quantified that was more specific with these speeches. umm, how many of them did he proofread and edit versus how many did he like author himself. umm...
meg (0:39:08.3):  yeah.
david (0:39:25.6):  you know, but, umm, for sure i think he's--he has better writing skills, but see part of this job too is like presentation skills and like, you know, what the--whatta--i guess i don't know with the type--typo or not, but. yeah.
meg (0:39:42.8):  well, do we wanna go over the pluses of mark also, like again? i don't know. i don't know what--there's a b--or weigh them against each other. you guys tell me.
caroline (0:39:57.0):  well, umm, just a side point. well, we've kind of put them on an even basis in terms of g--gpa being that jacob is kind of like, you know, okay and mark doesn't list anything besides a couple of awards. could we kind of put that on like a...
david (0:39:59.4):  yeah. that seems fair.
caroline (0:40:01.0):  sort of tends to level out.
meg (0:40:01.2):  well...
barney (0:40:01.6):  a...
meg (0:40:03.3):  sorry. go ahead.
barney (0:40:03.6):  and, of course, umm, since jacob earned fifty percent of his education, means he was working and going to college. which means he probably could have done a lot better in college (???)...)
rebecca (0:40:11.2):  since he only...
caroline (0:40:12.0):  but it's always ...
rebecca (0:40:12.4):  but it's over (???) the summer...
caroline (0:40:13.3):  ...the summer, yeah.
meg (0:40:18.8):  mark was working during the year and jacob was only working during the summers.
barney (0:40:19.8):  oh, yeah.
rebecca (0:40:21.9):  well, mark was only an ra during the year, i mean.
meg (0:40:23.7):  yeah, but an ra's not easy.
rebecca (0:40:28.7):  yeah, but it like works around your school schedule, 'cause it's through the school.
meg (0:40:39.2):  yeah, but it doesn't mean that you don't have ta'--i mean, if--if--if all jacob is doing is working over the summers and participating in his frat stuff. i think that's like the same sort of thing.
caroline (0:40:40.6):  yeah, but...
meg (0:40:40.9):  but i think that being an ra you have to manage more things. you have to...
rebecca (0:40:44.1):  well,
meg (0:40:50.4):  ... you have to be accountable for your residents and you have to like hold certain events.
rebecca (0:40:54.1):  he might have to with fr--fraternity also.
jeremy (0:40:56.8):  to me it boils down to, a, jacob--they both have a good amount of experience. jacob seems to have like a more social experience. while mark's...
caroline (0:41:04.1):  uh huh.
jeremy (0:41:19.3):  ...a experience is more formal. he has that, a, a good internship and, a, the ra. i like how he elaborated on that. programs, advice, 60 residents, that's impressive. so...
david (0:41:19.7):  yeah. at this point, i think actually i--i could be convinced, but i'm sort of leaning towards mark...
caroline (0:41:25.8):  yes.
david (0:41:26.1):  ...because...
caroline (0:41:26.6):  i'd agree.
david (0:41:37.1):  the job description does for sure emphasize like these, a, people skills that we keep talking about. but a lot of it is, a, the writing and, a...
meg (0:41:39.6):  well, why don't we go...
david (0:41:40.1):  ???
meg (0:41:43.6):  ...back through the job description, 'cause that'll probably give us our answer.
barney (0:41:44.7):  yeah. i.
meg (0:42:13.4):  so, like they want motivated team player. i mean, they're both motivated and they both have people skills. and they want a bachelor's degree in one of the related fields. and mark doesn't have a bachelor's degree in business, or journalism, or communication, but it's in psych. which is a good thing or a bad thing depending on where he focused in.
caroline (0:42:16.8):  i think that's fine supplemented by his professional experience.
meg (0:42:17.7):  i think so too.
david (0:42:18.0):  yeah.
meg (0:42:38.9):  i mean, if they're gonna develop and implement strategies, we see that with mark's more than we see it with jacob's, because mark has to like write, proof, and edit these speeches and press releases, so.
david (0:42:42.6):  yeah. on that particular point, he has an edge i think over jacob.
rebecca (0:42:52.3):  but then jacob also has the, he has the brochure for an apartment leasing company and for, a, presentation for the school.
meg (0:42:53.0):  yeah, but we...
rebecca (0:42:54.6):  so he does have some.
caroline (0:42:54.7):  kind of less formal level...
rebecca (0:42:55.8):  yeah.
meg (0:42:56.2):  ...i guess.
meg (0:42:56.7):  yeah.
caroline (0:42:57.1):  uh huh.
david (0:42:57.4):  yeah, okay.
meg (0:43:26.5):  i mean, the thing about the res hall that goes with this also is that, like, you have to design content for internal and external like media. whether it be web sites or like the programs that he's putting out. like the information that he's providing. and he (???) with information for his residents. so i feel like that's both an internal and external thing. as--like in--in his job, too.
rebecca (0:43:27.8):  wait, what did you say?
meg (0:43:36.7):  it says they will support the (???) goals of the organization by designing content for internal and external web sites and social media.
caroline (0:43:37.4):  right.
meg (0:43:46.0):  so i think that mark's experience lends itself more to internal and external interactions than jacob's does.
david (0:43:51.9):  right. yeah. like service liaison between residents and student affairs administration.
meg (0:43:52.9):  yeah.
david (0:43:53.1):  so he was advocating for...
meg (0:43:55.0):  both sides.
david (0:44:01.4):  ...residents probably. and, but also listening to what they say, you know. yeah.
meg (0:44:17.4):  plus, i mean, if he's working, or if he worked with that management intern, then he was working with other people in his office to put forth these press releases and speeches.
jeremy (0:44:46.8):  i'm looking at the, a, the bullets under responsibilities, include, but are not limited to. a, the, a, four little stars there, i think, a, mark takes it on the first three and jacob may have an advantage on the last one. although, mark doesn't really tout his, a, social abilities or, kind of a downfall just looking at paper instead of interviewing 'em. but, a, i think, a, mark kinda takes it there.
meg (0:44:48.6):  i mean, if this was a real short list, we could interview both of them, but...
jeremy (0:44:51.7):  yeah.
meg (0:44:52.2):  ???
jeremy (0:44:52.7):  there you go.
meg (0:44:59.0):  i don--i think they both would be good for the job.
jeremy (0:45:12.8):  oh, yeah, absolutely. i think they have--both have their pros and cons, but when it comes down to one. all right. do you wanna go around the table and just pick who you like the best?
meg (0:45:17.2):  we still got another hour, so we--we can keep talking about this.
jeremy (0:45:17.9):  okay.
meg (0:45:20.1):  sorry, what were you gonna say?
vicky (0:45:40.7):  umm, with jacob, i just noticed a kind of weird discrepancy, there, umm, i mean, not just the typo, this is a little bit less picky than that. umm, under management training, organizational ability. he says that he performed restaurant duties ranging from busboy to night mananger. if he has official management experience, why didn't he list that in his work experience?
meg (0:45:42.2):  umm.
vicky (0:45:42.2):  that's a strange, umm, typo. it makes me wonder, was he officially a mananger ever or did he jump in one night when the manager was sick...
jeremy (0:45:53.8):  yeah.|
vicky (0:45:54.9):  ...and vomiting in the bathroom.
jeremy (0:45:58.6):  maybe it was 'cause it was night he didn't really do that much. so he didn't really consider it.
caroline (0:45:58.8):  uh huh.
jeremy (0:45:59.3):  and maybe that speaks on his char..
caroline (0:45:59.9):  ???
vicky (0:45:59.9):  but...
jeremy (0:46:00.9):  ...on his part then for not putting it.
vicky (0:46:10.1):  ...if he had management experience and this is management, he would be listing that under work experience even if it was like two months. he just wouldn't put dates. he would put mananger.
jeremy (0:46:11.0):  right.
barney (0:46:16.1):  probably something he did occasionally when the manager was sick or something like that. they would just assign him the job temporarily.
vicky (0:46:16.6):  umm.
meg (0:46:18.2):  even with that, that's...
david (0:46:27.1):  yeah. i mean, i don't think he's trying to be like deceptive. umm, i don't think he was an official manager, i think is basically what that says, like.
caroline (0:46:27.3):  uh huh.
david (0:46:43.0):  it very clearly says like, it very clearly states that he performed duties ranging from that. so, likely when the night manager had the night off or was sick he would, a, kind of substitute and learn some of those duties. but, umm, he didn't have the official title.
vicky (0:47:00.0):  that's something he still could have listed under actual work experience, though. umm, whether you see that as being deceptive, or whether it's just not persuasive writing, or not organized writing. the way he put that together was a very poor choice considering how small his work experience is.
david (0:47:16.9):  umm, but i mean, he's not a night manager, so if he were to put it under work experience that would be, a, over--that would be embellishing and like, this, a, characterizing is--is a work experience. so, i--i mean, i think it's appropriate there.
vicky (0:47:17.5):  umm.
david (0:47:26.2):  yeah. like i don't see that as a very a--as a--i don't see it as significant, basically.
vicky (0:47:26.5):  humm.
caroline (0:47:58.6):  i think that jacob is kind of a gamble in the sense that i feel like he has the potential to grow and flourish in the job, but i don't think that he has enough professional experience to really make that a sure thing. whereas, i feel like with mark he has professional experience and i feel like he would kind of, umm, perform what was needed. but i have less confidence that he might flourish. does that make sense?
david (0:47:59.5):  yeah.
rebecca (0:48:08.0):  yeah. 'cause jacob kind of went out of his way, ta' you know, it wasn't his job--like he didn't need to do these extra activities while he was at school.
caroline (0:48:08.5):  umm.
moderator (0:48:09.8):  so.
vicky (0:48:11.3):  if this was a real situation. i think jacob's really promising, and mark's really promising. i would never hiether--hire either one of them as a manager. when one has one internship under his belt and one has been a waiter...
rebecca (0:48:22.3):  well, (???) not for a...
vicky (0:48:22.9):  ...during the summer.
rebecca (0:48:24.0):  ...management position.
vicky (0:48:29.9):  umm, it's the specialist who lead the team, isn't it?
caroline (0:48:31.2):  umm.
david (0:48:31.8):  yeah, but we can't...
vicky (0:48:32.1):  that's what i read.
david (0:48:32.4):  ...really umm, we have to hire the people that apply.
vicky (0:48:35.8):  right. we have to hire...
david (0:48:37.0):  i would say, a...
vicky (0:48:38.0):  ...one of these people. in real life i wouldn't.
david (0:48:38.8):  mark, because of what (???) just said.
caroline (0:48:42.7):  (caroline), jess is fine.
david (0:49:24.3):  actually, she made a good point, that seems like makes sense too is that, umm, yeah, for sure, like, there's less risk involved with, a, mark. like there's really evidence that, a, he had the, a, professional experience, umm, for, eight months. and, umm, i think, a, yeah. i think, umm, with jacob, umm, yeah. you cou--it could go, a, either way if you hire him even.
barney (0:49:37.9):  sometell--somehow i got, i don't know if this really applies or not. but i got a feeling that jacob's a guy who likes to party a lot, go out and drink and stuff, well, not so much with mark. some, just--yeah.
meg (0:49:39.7):  no, i got that feeling too. he's--
david (0:49:40.5):  yeah, for sure.
meg (0:49:42.3):  i mean, if he's in a frat, i mean.
meg (0:49:42.6):  well, and not to characterize...
rebecca (0:49:43.1):  well, it's--
meg (0:49:43.5):  ...all frat boys...
rebecca (0:49:44.3):  it's a professional frat.
meg (0:49:44.6):  ...(???) a certain way.
rebecca (0:49:45.5):  ...professional frat...
caroline (0:49:45.9):  ...it's completely different.
rebecca (0:49:47.4):  ...it's not a social frat.
meg (0:49:47.6):  a, my ex-roommates were in professional frat...
rebecca (0:49:49.7):  yeah. i'm just saying, though, like it's not like a frat boy...
meg (0:49:51.8):  no, no. i know, but they were in a professional frat and they did the same sort of thing, sort of things as a...
rebecca (0:49:57.5):  yeah, i--i mean, social...
meg (0:49:59.0):  ...social frat did.
rebecca (0:49:59.0):  i'm in that frat, so, not yet.
meg (0:50:03.7):  well, i'm not saying anything bad about it.
rebecca (0:50:09.3):  no. no. i'm saying there--there definitely is drinking involved, but just not--it's not like a social frat. like that's, yeah.
caroline (0:50:23.3):  well, i think to go along with that, i think that could be considered a good thing too. because i think this job definitely calls for someone who is extroverted. they have to organize and manage events. they have to do all these things that, umm--well i guess i'm sort of...
rebecca (0:50:24.1):  yeah, it says right here...
caroline (0:50:24.8):  umm.
rebecca (0:50:26.2):  ...special events and parties.
jeremy (0:50:26.5):  parties.
david (0:50:26.9):  right.
david (0:50:30.2):  yeah. see that's--that's--that's what makes it such a...
meg (0:50:30.5):  but.
david (0:50:56.9):  ...difficult task, because you want someone who's really agressive socially, i think for this job. on the other hand, umm, i keep looking at the job description and thinking that it's not quite as like, umm, emphasizing, umm, like the social aspects as, a, as would be a perfect ma--it's--it's like still a better match for mark because of the presentation. a, the written skills, umm.
meg (0:51:00.2):  but mark's got the social aspect too 'cause...
rebecca (0:51:05.8):  and the same--and also when you're making a resume you don't try and make it look like you're social, you know.
meg (0:51:06.7):  yeah.
caroline (0:51:07.0):  so.
david (0:51:07.4):  yeah.
jeremy (0:51:07.7):  humpf.
meg (0:51:08.1):  but he says that he developed programs for like he--he--the programs are--are not just like, umm, they can be social events...
rebecca (0:51:18.1):  uh huh.
meg (0:51:18.4):  ...too.
rebecca (0:51:19.1):  that's true.
meg (0:51:20.7):  so that's the other thing. it's like.
david (0:51:33.1):  yeah. just say manage special events such as sponserships, parties, introducing new products, or relationships, umm, to gain public attention. so you do want someone who will like promote, umm.
meg (0:51:35.1):  the product?
david (0:51:43.2):  yeah. yeah. so you really want someone really, a, extroverted, but still likeable.
jeremy (0:51:44.2):  yeah.
david (0:51:48.8):  not like conceited, of course, or not like, umm, (???).
jeremy (0:51:54.6):  so equal parts like hypeman and part like manager too.
meg (0:51:57.6):  i don't know i still feel like mark has the better experience and...
caroline (0:52:03.7):  well... i'm sorry, go ahead.
meg (0:52:04.0):  no, go ahead.
caroline (0:52:24.8):  well, i pretty much, i said this before, i just feel like jacob has the potential to totally grow into this position. i--and he also has the potential to end up not being great at all, because he has nothing professional to really back it. but i think that mark, umm, has the ability right now to handle it.
barney (0:52:45.1):  well, to me this, umm, this is kind of deciding factor. i know maybe a little superficial, 'cause you really can't tell this from a resume. but when i read these two, a, mark see--mark seems like a friendly face to for--per--a--portray the company with. umm, jacob seems like a go-getter, which may either be a good thing or a bad thing depend---depending how you wanna port--portray the company.
david (0:53:03.7):  right. 'cause this is just designed to see how we interact together, just because like to--to get inside into our decision making. just 'cause like this wouldn't probably never, a, 'cause this is when you--we wanna call the references and ask.
meg (0:53:04.6):  umm, yeah.
david (0:53:04.7):  about what, how's...
jeremy (0:53:05.3):  yeah.
david (0:53:25.3):  ...mark. umm, and meet the--i mean, i guess this goes without saying, but, umm, yeah, to be clear--i don't know, i feel like it is still important to state that you would never, a, hire someone like this when--for the cost of nothing, you could easily just meet them and call their employers. umm, but, so it makes it really...
meg (0:53:26.8):  well, let's just pretend...
david (0:53:27.4):  ...difficult.
meg (0:53:30.9):  ...they're on a, on a unreachable island somewhere...
david (0:53:31.3):  yeah.
meg (0:53:43.3):  we can't call them. i--a--i--a really--i think jacob would be an o--a better candidate if mark wasn't sitting right next to 'em. i don't know.
caroline (0:53:43.5):  uh huh.
meg (0:54:05.5):  i--i feel like against all of the other candidates, he's obviously the best. but against mark he's not. i mean, he does have public service in his bachelor's degree, but he doesn't have--. i don't know. i--i don't--i don't necassarily think that he's the go-getter that you think he is.
david (0:54:40.5):  yeah, but his summary of qualifications is nice, too. umm, you know, creative, resourceful, and flexible, able to adapt to changing priorities and maintain a positive attitude and strong work ethics. so you can see how that fits into the will it be required in this setting here at the growing e-commerce company. motivated team player, someone who can roll with punches at that, umm, whereas jacob doesn't have the--he doesn't even have like a--a few sentences, like a couple...
caroline (0:54:40.8):  uh huh.
david (0:54:44.1):  i mean, these aren't sentences either, but...
caroline (0:54:44.6):  i know that...
david (0:54:45.6):  ???/sorry.
caroline (0:54:47.4):  sor-- i'm sorry i keep interrupting people.
david (0:54:47.7):  ???
caroline (0:54:59.6):  i know that you had said before that like anyone could say anything they wanted to in the highlights and qualifications, but i think that the fact that he knew that over jacob makes him more of a professional to even add that.
david (0:55:08.2):  yeah. 'cause he picked out these things from this job description and that's what he chose to highlight or tailor for this particular, a, resume that he submitted.
meg (0:55:22.7):  i actually just saw something else. mark's resume says he wants the position as a me--media relations specialist, which is what the job's for. and jacob says media relations executive. i don't know if we want to be that nick--nitpicky, but.
barney (0:55:30.0):  yeah. and it's not even in grammatical, you know, his objective. so, i think this is more like a generic thing and this was specially written for the, umm, job.
meg (0:55:30.8):  uh huh. yeah.
jeremy (0:55:31.0):  humpf.
david (0:55:31.5):  yeah.
meg (0:55:35.4):  i don't know. i don't think.
david (0:55:41.8):  yeah. clearly with this like he--he cared, 'cause he read the job description and.
meg (0:55:43.6):  and he tailored his application...
david (0:55:44.3):  yeah.
meg (0:55:45.1):  ...to the job.
david (0:55:50.2):  umm, which shows like a high le--shows some interest compared to a...
jeremy (0:55:50.4):  yeah.
david (0:55:58.0):  ...media relations executive is not--that takes a lifetime probably to...
meg (0:55:58.5):  yeah.
david (0:56:00.4):  ...achieve. (???).
barney (0:56:09.0):  and he probably should have said like something like my goal is to lead or something. just go to lead and train management staff, i don't--just doesn't sound grammatical.
meg (0:56:28.3):  yeah. well, i mean, as a bullet point it's not terrible, but i think he should have used maybe just--just at least reread it or read it aloud to himself one--once more before submitting it. goal to lead and train and management staff.
david (0:56:36.2):  right. 'cause it says some of the responsibilities are write interesting and effective press releases and prepare information for ads and/or media kits.
vicky (0:56:39.6):  so we have to be nitpicky, because this is what his job would be.
meg (0:56:40.0):  yeah.
vicky (0:56:40.7):  is to create...
david (0:56:41.1):  yeah.
vicky (0:56:42.3):  ...convincing documents.
david (0:56:42.5):  (???)
vicky (0:56:57.9):  his document is convincing and i think in some ways it's more convincing than mark's. i like the way it's laid out. i like how he specifically picked out the different skills that are relevant to the position. umm, in other ways, some of it's weird. some of it's sloppy, he has a typo.
meg (0:57:23.3):  yeah. well, on that side of it, i mean, he's got--we're gonna be super nitpicky, under his skills like the third hi--like line he's got everything tabbed over in the lines before, the second part of it is not in line. you know, it just looks a little messy to me. and if you're gonna be creating a press releases, then i think you might want it to look a little neater.
caroline (0:57:31.7):  well, personally, i think both resumes are hideous looking. but i think jacob's is worse. jacob's to me looks like an email.
david (0:57:37.0):  yeah. it's--it's a little bit busy i think for sure.
vicky (0:57:37.5):  uh huh.
david (0:57:40.5):  like with the education, i mean.
rebecca (0:57:44.0):  and he had the room to like space it out more...
caroline (0:57:44.4):  uh huh.
rebecca (0:57:45.1):  ...and make it look better.
david (0:57:58.7):  but i think mark's was also a lot simpler. i mean, it--it didn't show that he, umm, really knew how to use all the word processing software very much, but...
caroline (0:57:59.3):  yeah.
david (0:58:05.3):  ...but jacob showed that he, umm, had a better comprehension of word processing software, even though it wasn't perfect.
rebecca (0:58:08.4):  but just that he had like a header type thing.
caroline (0:58:09.0):  umm.
caroline (0:58:10.4):  just even that.
vicky (0:58:31.4):  one thing that i--keeps jumping out at me from jacob's, is under the communications language tab, the last part there. traveled around the world with semester at cnu's, conversational and communications skills to interact with local area natives. one, it's redundant, conversational and communication skills, because when he was "communicating with the natives"...
david (0:58:32.2):  (???)
vicky (0:58:36.9):  ...only part of it was conversation, the rest of it was, a, sign language he made up on the spot.
meg (0:58:37.4):  yeah.
vicky (0:58:38.4):  to interact with them.
david (0:58:38.8):  yeah. we've local as opposed to distant area natives. so, i don't even know why he...
vicky (0:58:43.4):  plus natives.
david (0:58:44.5):  ...put local.
vicky (0:58:45.1):  like.
david (0:58:50.0):  no, it's probably appropriate, i guess, 'cause.
meg (0:58:51.7):  i don't know i think...
david (0:58:53.1):  they were from the (???).
meg (0:58:54.6):  i think the language is offensive.
caroline (0:59:11.1):  well, i think that what that serves as is, a, an interesting like talking and conversational point. and, but i think that it also goes along with sort of his brand as this extroverted, umm...
meg (0:59:11.5):  partier.
caroline (0:59:12.0):  exactly.
meg (0:59:12.3):  guy.
caroline (0:59:18.1):  so i think that were it not to be there, it wouldn't, i don't know.
vicky (0:59:18.9):  i think it's--it's good because it shows that he can communicate with people from other cultures and that's a very good thing in advertising. but the way he wrote it, it was so ineffective and...
jeremy (0:59:29.2):  yeah.
vicky (0:59:30.6):  ...almost offensive in a way.
jeremy (0:59:34.0):  yeah. this is like...
vicky (0:59:38.0):  he's--he's proving and disprov--he's proving and disproving his point in that...
meg (0:59:38.1):  yeah.
vicky (0:59:39.5):  ...sentence.
caroline (0:59:54.7):  well, i think you're kind of influencing me, umm, also with, umm, what you had said long ago about the typo. just that he may put a very, umm, unprofessional face on the company, just through small things like that.
david (1:00:22.9):  yeah. this is, umm, like heavy on image and like more, a, this attempts to be like really emphasize like flash more than this is, a, very substantive and, umm, the job description says, you know, excellent verbal and written skills. a, strong creative--strong writing skills basically.
meg (1:00:38.3):  yeah. umm, i don't know, i think the fact that mark has all these scholarships. i mean, he doesn't have his gpa listed, which is definitely.
david (1:00:39.2):  he's very understated.
meg (1:00:39.9):  yeah.
david (1:00:52.0):  he's--he's, a, not as concerned about, a, appearance, which, umm, which could be sort of, a, difficult for this job, but...
vicky (1:00:52.4):  uh huh.
david (1:00:53.3):  ...umm,
meg (1:00:54.0):  but he does have...
david (1:00:54.6):  i think that's fine in it...
meg (1:00:59.7):  ...creativity aspect in the hallmark award competition.
david (1:01:00.8):  yeah.
meg (1:01:01.7):  the art competition.
david (1:01:03.3):  right. yeah, that's true.
barney (1:01:07.6):  i also like that mark's, umm, it was--it was simpler to read. umm.
meg (1:01:09.9):  yeah. it's not as busy.
barney (1:01:10.9):  yeah.
jeremy (1:01:12.2):  yeah. well, laid out.
caroline (1:01:19.0):  and honestly, something as simple as layout is a skill that they need to have for this job.
jeremy (1:01:19.6):  uh huh.
caroline (1:01:25.2):  whether it's designing an ad, a web site or something else.
rebecca (1:01:33.8):  yeah. jacob is saying that he has like created these brochures and this presentation, but like he can't put together a resume. so.
vicky (1:01:36.3):  i think that if we were going to call them in, we would probably need to have a small portfolio with both of them to see what...
caroline (1:01:41.9):  umm.
vicky (1:01:42.0):  ...sort of...
jeremy (1:01:42.4):  absolutely.
vicky (1:01:42.8):  ...related documents...
jeremy (1:01:43.3):  yeah.
caroline (1:01:43.4):  uh huh.
vicky (1:01:44.1):  ...can you provide.
meg (1:01:44.8):  yeah.
vicky (1:01:46.2):  and look at it that way.
meg (1:02:13.3):  i don't know. i feel like jacob's got this pamphlet for the brochure for the apartment leasing ocmpany, but then mark's got all the, umm, speeches, press releases from his internship. plus, the stuff that he did with the res hall. i think that's--i think he's probably got more stuff to show us. that he's prepared for the job itself.
barney (1:02:52.0):  i--i think mark's a better writer this--but he might be a little, umm, slightly too introverted. although, it's impossible to tell from this. or he might be the nice guy you wanna portray your company as. it depends, like, what--ho--what you wanna portray your company as. if you want the, umm, if you want the go-getter, we're gonna (???), make as much money as possible, whatever, jacob would be the guy. and mark would be the guy if you just wanna--wanna portray your company as someone very nice.
david (1:03:23.6):  yeah. i mean, jacob has like a lot of hustle for sure. it's just very aggressive. he earned 50 percent of educational expenses. umm, he's, a, seems real persistent, a, with people, you know, i think. umm, so he'd be like charming and, a, persuasive, but this isn't sales as much as it is, a, writing press releases, presentations, so. umm.
meg (1:03:41.7):  that's the other thing that i--like it's kind of good that you can't meet these people for a fake job. because jacob might come in here and be like all charming and like, no, i'll--i'll be super good at this job. and mark might be a little shier, but he might be the better candidate, because of his work experience and his training.
david (1:03:44.2):  yeah.
caroline (1:03:44.4):  i think that's where our umm...
david (1:03:45.9):  (???) professional--go ahead...
caroline (1:03:53.9):  sorry. i think that's why our portfolio, like you were saying, would ocme in handy too, just it's evidence to their claims.
vicky (1:04:05.8):  uh huh. i think that in some way jacob is the best candidate and the worst candidate and mark is sort of middle of the road.
meg (1:04:06.8):  yeah.
jeremy (1:04:09.8):  a, mark's a safer bet from just looking at these two.
caroline (1:04:11.4):  i completely agree.
vicky (1:04:18.6):  he hasn't thrown all the parties, which is one thing that we do want for this job. he's supposed to manage special events and parties.
meg (1:04:19.3):  yeah.
jeremy (1:04:19.4):  yeah.
vicky (1:04:26.7):  that is part of it, but at the same time, we don't feel like he's just going to totally drop the ball like jacob might.
meg (1:04:28.9):  plus, the parties, i mean, they're not supposed to be like crazy keggers.
jeremy (1:04:33.7):  it's not like crazy parties.
vicky (1:04:33.9):  right.
caroline (1:04:34.4):  yeah.
vicky (1:04:46.0):  but that social skill of walking around the room and making sure everybody, that you say hi to everybody, have you heard about our new product? i feel like jacob could probably do that from, just from his description of talking to the natives.
meg (1:04:53.4):  i think we're all in agreed...
david (1:05:02.2):  yeah, but i mean, how many natives from albany, new york? i'm not that--that--umm, let's not focus on it.
jeremy (1:05:02.7):  the terminology.
david (1:05:03.2):  what?
meg (1:05:05.0):  no. no. go ahead. i'd like to hear.
david (1:05:05.4):  yeah. i don't ev--even think mark is middle of the--of the road in terms of the resumes we've got. i think he's the--basically the best compared to the resumes we've seen.
meg (1:05:14.5):  oh, yeah.
barney (1:05:15.8):  just intuitively he was the one that i marked as number one resume.
caroline (1:05:18.0):  me too.
jeremy (1:05:18.4):  yeah.
meg (1:05:28.9):  humm, i don't know, i think the rest of them had parts of it. and it seems like mark and jacob have it all, but in differing degrees.
vicky (1:05:30.4):  right. i--i wasn't comparing him to a list of all the other candidates, i was just looking at, as far as our...
meg (1:05:35.8):  like the (???) candidate.
vicky (1:05:36.4):  ...characteristics for the ideal candidate...
meg (1:05:38.4):  yeah.
vicky (1:05:41.1):  ...with the job description.
meg (1:05:48.6):  i think mark's the guy.
barney (1:05:52.7):  i vote for mark.
meg (1:05:54.3):  i think we're all agreed.
caroline (1:05:54.6):  yeah.
jeremy (1:05:57.5):  yeah. i like mark. he has his core skills there, the professionalism.
meg (1:05:58.5):  he does.
jeremy (1:06:16.7):  and if you strip away like the social stuff, 'cause you can't really judge that. i mean, you can really say anything. or i mean on--in their resumes, when you take away, a, what they say about their social skills, when you--you have that, the core skills that they built in their undergrad. i like what i see with mark.
meg (1:06:24.5):  and you can learn the other computer skills that he doesn't necessarily have.
jeremy (1:06:29.2):  yeah. we don't even know the level of the computer skills that, a, jacob has.
caroline (1:06:37.6):  i think a bachelor's degree qualifies you to really learn something as basic as a computer skill. so, i don't think that's that big of a issue.
david (1:06:44.6):  yeah. i mean, plus, for the required skills, they're all things he basically already knows for required skills.
meg (1:06:45.0):  yeah.
rebecca (1:06:56.1):  yeah, and it's just, when they talk about content for the web sites. like they say designing content, not like actually designing the web site. it's just the content, so.
meg (1:06:56.3):  yeah.
jeremy (1:06:56.6):  that's a good point, yeah.
jeremy (1:07:14.7):  and they only say word, power point, excel. so if you really--if you take out html, i mean, the web site's probably gonna be there and they probably already have the infrastructure of the web site. so you're just gonna be updating with text. you can see mark has the better writing skills. they both know microsoft word. so, then it works better.
barney (1:07:17.4):  and he's got the artistic skills too.
jeremy (1:07:18.1):  yeah, the award.
meg (1:07:18.5):  yeah.
barney (1:07:25.8):  that's--that's--that to me is a lot harder to pick up than something like html. but i'm also a computer science major, so. i could be--i could be biased.
meg (1:07:42.4):  and i think, all right, mark's it. yea. should we discuss anything else?
moderator (1:07:49.4):  umm, umm, actually, i think the, let me go get thomas.
meg (1:07:49.8):  okay.
rebecca (1:07:54.3):  this--this, a, (???).
barney (1:07:57.7):  from what i hear, if this was a real meeting, it probably woulda been over in like ten minutes.
caroline (1:08:02.3):  yeah, in a way, yeah.
jeremy (1:08:04.5):  exactly. it was shoo, shoo.
barney (1:08:07.7):  so, if one word they don't like they just throw it away.
vicky (1:08:14.9):  i think there's a lot of resumes being thrown away right now.
meg (1:08:23.7):  yeah. i don't know, i kind of liked sally's, just 'cause she's the massage therapist. so she's gotta have the people skills for massage therapist.
barney (1:08:27.9):  yeah. she was my number two, between her and mark. okay.
jeremy (1:08:30.8):  really?
meg (1:08:51.5):  coulda been much worse. these--these jobs, i mean, i mean, some of the resumes that we had for the other jobs that we were deciding on online, that was during the last session, they're like really hard to choose because the canidates were like so closely matched.
jeremy (1:08:52.0):  humm.
meg (1:09:19.9):  that it was just like--like one person didn't like it because of, like something really ridiculous and the other person didn't like him because he was a boy or something like that. really random things to argue over. glad we all agreed.
jeremy (1:09:21.7):  how long did that take?
meg (1:09:22.7):  makes life a lot easier.
jeremy (1:09:23.9):  oh.
meg (1:09:25.5):  only twenty after five.
moderator (1:09:48.1):  that was good. umm, i have some, a, questionnaire that i'd like to read, ask you guys to fill out this gives the impression of what--what went on.
david (1:09:56.7):  thanks.
jeremy (1:10:07.7):  thanks.
meg (1:10:12.1):  this definitely giving me things to think about for my own resume.
moderator (1:15:30.2):  well, thank you all for coming. i hope this was not, a, completely boring. that it was an enjoyable experience and this is a similar kind of thing that we do online, if you choose to participate online. umm, they'll be, you know, more discussions of these sorts there. you have a resume to choose from such as this. or like thomas said, pick a best new movie of the year, things like that. so, a, thank you all for coming. 
meg (1:15:35.7):  i think we can take these off.
david (1:15:43.0):  so is this more enjoyable than doing your online thing?
meg (1:16:04.1):  umm, yes. (???) the internet. so it's not so--i mean, i'd--i'd be typing up stuff (???).
thomas (1:16:09.2):  hi, guys, i hope it was fun enough. you would do this again?
meg (1:16:10.0):  yeah. i'd do it.
jeremy (1:16:10.9):  yeah.
thomas (1:17:53.7):  okay. in fact, i invite everyone to participate in online. probably do another session, some--some other topic. in fact, also invite you to suggest topics that you--'cause i don't have a monopoly. sometimes i sit there and think of… you know, group of folks like you find interesting. i mean, i don't know. so, umm, you know, anyone could suggest a topic. and you know, with this, you know, as--as long as this is something that you think will cause some nice discussion. and--and we have--we have tried that before. so, it's a--it works and then you--you become a leader and--and, a, we use your topic. can convince other of your viewpoint. so, all right. wonderful, then, umm, umm, i don't know what else to say except for that thank you. and, a, we--we have your, a, emails so we can get in touch, you know, if--if you are available for the, a, online. when--when we go on and do online over next few weeks. so, moderator will try to schedule those sessions. and then this will take us a little bit to transcribe. and, a, and that will have to think a little bit and see, umm, maybe in another month or two we'll do another session. a, that's kind of the plan. but in between, we do the online. okay. and if you have any questions, you know, at any time, whatever just drop us mail. thank you. thank you so much.

melany (20:13:15 PM):  yeah he seems like a leader
melany (20:13:19 PM):  with his leadership experience
caroline (20:13:20 PM):  he has experience with the area of health but it wasn't hands on
rita (20:13:26 PM):  Would you say the Albany area has more elderly that speak Spanish or German?
melany (20:13:38 PM):  i'd say spanish
melany (20:13:41 PM):  but thats just a guess
judith (20:14:20 PM):  id also say spanish
rita (20:14:21 PM):  Why I mention that is that while Alex speaks Spanish Jeremy speaks German
julie (20:14:22 PM):  yes, we couldnt know
julie (20:14:28 PM):  but the option is possible
caroline (20:14:42 PM):  i think any second language is aplus
julie (20:14:45 PM):  id say spanish is more popular
melany (20:14:46 PM):  being bilingual is always helpful
rita (20:15:01 PM):  Well, what is the difference exactly between proficiency and conversant
julie (20:15:15 PM):  idk
melany (20:15:32 PM):  i like how he has experience with patient record organization
melany (20:15:36 PM):  that should be helpful
rita (20:15:39 PM):  Alex is proficient in Spanish while Jeremy is conversant in German
judith (20:16:15 PM):  proficient is more fluent
judith (20:16:26 PM):  conversent i think is basically u can hold a basic conversation
melany (20:16:30 PM):  yeah
melany (20:16:31 PM):  i agree
melany (20:16:49 PM):  he did fundraising management
melany (20:16:51 PM):  could be helpful
julie (20:16:54 PM):  well alex looks good then
melany (20:16:55 PM):  seems like a very capable candidate
julie (20:17:02 PM):  yes
melany (20:17:06 PM):  let's discuss natalie
melany (20:17:19 PM):  very smart girl in terms of school
melany (20:17:33 PM):  experienced with meal operations
rita (20:17:34 PM):  Natalie intrigued me because she had experience with Homebound meals
melany (20:17:39 PM):  which is very relevant to this job
caroline (20:17:48 PM):  that impressed me
melany (20:17:52 PM):  and she is also involved with Red Cross
judith (20:17:53 PM):  she was my favorite
melany (20:17:56 PM):  which could be helpful
melany (20:18:01 PM):  she is a very strong candidate
judith (20:18:04 PM):  she has a lot of volinteer experience in differnet areas
julie (20:18:06 PM):  yes both good to have
melany (20:18:06 PM):  seems to meet all requirements
julie (20:18:13 PM):  yes
caroline (20:18:27 PM):  it seems like her internship was also every interactive with the public which i believe is relevant
judith (20:18:48 PM):  agreed
melany (20:19:02 PM):  she must be a pleasant person to interact with based on her human services experience
julie (20:19:19 PM):  and she was a sales associate so she had to deal with alot of people
julie (20:19:54 PM):  and also dealt with young kids
rita (20:20:22 PM):  I could see Natalie excelling at this job and moving up into a management position with the organization
melany (20:20:22 PM):  overall, a very good candidate
judith (20:20:43 PM):  she seems quite driven
julie (20:21:20 PM):  yes
rita (20:21:27 PM):  Natalie has a BS in Human Services which is good
julie (20:21:39 PM):  yes
melany (20:21:46 PM):  yeah a prime aspect of the job
rita (20:22:00 PM):  What is an AA in Liberal Arts? Associates?
melany (20:22:15 PM):  i think so
caroline (20:22:38 PM):  yes
julie (20:22:44 PM):  yes
melany (20:22:51 PM):  so natalie is definetly a strong option
julie (20:22:56 PM):  id say so
melany (20:22:56 PM):  what about the next candidate
rita (20:23:01 PM):  Does NY state or specifically SUNY have one of those compact agreements with local Community Colleges to transfer all credits?
melany (20:23:01 PM):  jeremy?
caroline (20:23:10 PM):  no
julie (20:23:47 PM):  i thought jeremy was a good because of his CPR skills
judith (20:23:49 PM):  i dont think so
melany (20:24:06 PM):  he is also a welfare specialist
caroline (20:24:15 PM):  i thought that was a plus as well
melany (20:24:20 PM):  which is definetly a plis
melany (20:24:21 PM):  plus*
judith (20:24:23 PM):  CPR is very important in these types of jobs too
melany (20:24:28 PM):  he clearly works well with people
judith (20:24:29 PM):  a lot of times they are required
melany (20:24:32 PM):  yeah who knows what could happen
julie (20:24:32 PM):  he also trained people at his job, so that means he had to have interacted well with people
caroline (20:24:53 PM):  i also liked his objective, maybe this is a stepping stone to a future career which might make him dedicated
rita (20:24:56 PM):  I guess my point is ... she was smart to knock out some of her credits at a cheaper place before finishing at a more expensive one ... or she comes from a poor background and this was the only option
rita (20:25:16 PM):  Either way I like her thinking
melany (20:25:42 PM):  yeah that is good thinking
rita (20:25:44 PM):  Jeremy - Social Services experience and German speaking, not bad
julie (20:25:46 PM):  i agree with caroline
melany (20:26:05 PM):  yeah better or worse than natalie?
julie (20:26:16 PM):  better
caroline (20:26:42 PM):  better
rita (20:26:47 PM):  Natalie trained volunteers
luke (20:27:13 PM):  hi guys sorry im late my internet hasnt been working right all day
melany (20:27:30 PM):  he's a sociology major which is good
caroline (20:27:58 PM):  yes aplicable
julie (20:28:09 PM):  yes
rita (20:28:35 PM):  I noticed that he had experience driving people to and from stuff ... this job requires taking people to doctors appointments
julie (20:28:56 PM):  yes i believe that is important
melany (20:28:59 PM):  yeah he has transportation experience
melany (20:29:05 PM):  probably has a clean liscence
julie (20:29:10 PM):  that means he is hopefully responsible and timely
luke (20:29:16 PM):  have u guys narrowed it down to a couple of people?
julie (20:29:29 PM):  were just discussing everyone
luke (20:29:33 PM):  oooh ok
melany (20:29:38 PM):  we discussed natalie, alexander, and jeremy
caroline (20:29:38 PM):  the transportation experience is definitely important
rita (20:29:49 PM):  melany, I am surprised they didn't mention driving record requirements in the job ad ...nice catch!
melany (20:30:02 PM):  now were moving on to brian
melany (20:30:04 PM):  thanks!
luke (20:30:09 PM):  kk thanks
julie (20:30:18 PM):  k
rita (20:30:44 PM):  Weird resume
caroline (20:30:58 PM):  why do you find it weird
julie (20:30:59 PM):  yea whats with all the question marks
luke (20:31:04 PM):  yeaa but he is a nursing major which is pretty good for this job
julie (20:31:12 PM):  i agree
judith (20:31:14 PM):  yea why does he have ? makes all over
melany (20:31:22 PM):  thats odd
melany (20:31:27 PM):  could be a technical error
julie (20:31:35 PM):  probably
julie (20:31:37 PM):  well
rita (20:31:40 PM):  I seemed almost like the resume was a draft and the ?? were to be filled in later
julie (20:31:49 PM):  i think the nursing thing is good
melany (20:31:59 PM):  he does have experience at a wellness clinci
melany (20:32:04 PM):  which is good
julie (20:32:12 PM):  yes, old people hot spot
luke (20:32:18 PM):  ha yeaa
judith (20:32:19 PM):  this is true
rita (20:32:19 PM):  Even though the medical thing is not supposed to be a factor - I think it is a definate plus
julie (20:32:28 PM):  yes
caroline (20:32:37 PM):  i agree
julie (20:32:42 PM):  helps with conversation as well
caroline (20:32:45 PM):  and i think the resume just didn't transfer well online
rita (20:32:46 PM):  julie - LOL
melany (20:32:59 PM):  clearly experience with taking care of others
julie (20:33:13 PM):  yes
melany (20:33:37 PM):  oh wow nursing degree
judith (20:34:01 PM):  and a member of nurses assoication
caroline (20:34:07 PM):  yea absolutely a plus
judith (20:34:08 PM):  does anyone know what experience u need to get into that?
melany (20:34:13 PM):  im not sure
luke (20:34:16 PM):  yeaa so he definately knows all about the health aspects and everything to go with the ob
julie (20:34:26 PM):  also applebees teamwork
julie (20:34:33 PM):  shows leader skills
melany (20:35:14 PM):  i think he is a strong candidate as well
caroline (20:35:19 PM):  agreed
melany (20:35:23 PM):  i think natalie, jeremy, and brian are strong possibilities
julie (20:35:30 PM):  yes
melany (20:35:36 PM):  she we eliminate the other two?
julie (20:35:41 PM):  my top pick is jeremy though
judith (20:35:43 PM):  i think so
luke (20:35:51 PM):  yea me too
melany (20:36:02 PM):  okay so alexander and megan are done
julie (20:36:10 PM):  yes
rita (20:36:17 PM):  what about our Spanish speaking friend Alex
julie (20:36:26 PM):  not good enough lol
melany (20:36:34 PM):  yeah i dont think he makes the cut
melany (20:36:37 PM):  compared to the others
judith (20:36:45 PM):  agree
julie (20:36:49 PM):  the others have more social skills
julie (20:36:59 PM):  and related job experience
luke (20:37:03 PM):  yea thats true
melany (20:37:12 PM):  okay so down to the final three
melany (20:37:20 PM):  what's everyone's thoughts?
luke (20:37:38 PM):  I think the one with the nursing major is my top one so far
julie (20:37:43 PM):  i like jeremy because that's the field of work he wants to be in
julie (20:37:55 PM):  this can help with his social service career
rita (20:37:58 PM):  I really think a second language is a major plus
melany (20:38:16 PM):  yeah i like jeremy as well because of the nursing primarily
julie (20:38:21 PM):  jeremy speaks german
julie (20:38:25 PM):  not that anyone else does
luke (20:38:35 PM):  yea i dont know if that would really be needed though
judith (20:38:42 PM):  i think that is irrelevant
caroline (20:38:45 PM):  i like jeremy and biran
julie (20:38:56 PM):  well brians the nursing one
melany (20:39:01 PM):  oh my mistake
melany (20:39:02 PM):  hmmm
melany (20:39:07 PM):  im torn between jeremy and brian then
julie (20:39:32 PM):  jeremy has more social skills than brian
julie (20:39:39 PM):  and a better looking resume
rita (20:39:40 PM):  Brian's resume is weird ... what is up with the ???s - I didn't like that
julie (20:39:43 PM):  shows he cares
melany (20:40:00 PM):  yeah thats odd
melany (20:40:18 PM):  must be some sort of transfer error
luke (20:40:23 PM):  well brian is also in a fraternity which needs some social skills there
rita (20:40:24 PM):  As a student the Nursing Association probably requires $25
melany (20:40:41 PM):  oh thats interesting
caroline (20:40:41 PM):  what?
rita (20:40:42 PM):  To answer that previous question
caroline (20:40:50 PM):  oh
rita (20:41:30 PM):  I think it is an honor society not fraternity
julie (20:41:47 PM):  jeremy sounds inventive and interesting, creating hands on approaches in math and science
melany (20:41:50 PM):  wow jeremy Financed 100% of educational expenses
julie (20:41:52 PM):  as well as smart
rita (20:42:05 PM):  I got into one of those honor society's for MLS with $50
luke (20:42:15 PM):  ooo i see
julie (20:42:56 PM):  that's impressive
melany (20:43:05 PM):  yeah clearly a driven guy
caroline (20:43:06 PM):  yea some of them are bs
judith (20:43:38 PM):  yea i agree
rita (20:43:38 PM):  And just a side note - from a librarian's perspective - the Who's who books just require a fee to get in ... I think Briwn is buying his credability
rita (20:43:47 PM):  *Brian
luke (20:43:51 PM):  haha looks like it
julie (20:44:04 PM):  ... i vote jeremy
melany (20:44:19 PM):  yeah jeremy seems better the more i compare the resumes
caroline (20:44:22 PM):  i have never even heard of that
luke (20:44:25 PM):  yea after u guys brought up those points.. i am more for jeremy now than i was before
judith (20:44:32 PM):  i like jeremy as well, for some reason those ?? on brian's were a real turnoff
rita (20:44:34 PM):  Did anyone ever see the movie or read " Catch me if you can"
luke (20:44:40 PM):  yea
rita (20:44:41 PM):  Watch out for the Brians
julie (20:44:47 PM):  ok
rita (20:44:51 PM):  of the world
julie (20:44:54 PM):  jeremy it is?
melany (20:44:56 PM):  hahaha thats funny
melany (20:44:58 PM):  i think so
julie (20:45:03 PM):  yay!
melany (20:45:04 PM):  does anyone want to discuss natalie more?
melany (20:45:08 PM):  she was also a prime candidate
rita (20:45:31 PM):  I liked Natalie
judith (20:45:40 PM):  i liked her but i liked jeremy better personally
melany (20:45:48 PM):  i think jeremy is better as well
julie (20:45:50 PM):  i agree
melany (20:45:56 PM):  what does jeremy have that natalie doesnt?
melany (20:46:00 PM):  just to extend the conversation
julie (20:46:07 PM):  she was good, if jeremy wasnt there
caroline (20:46:09 PM):  thats a good point
julie (20:46:18 PM):  hmmm
rita (20:46:52 PM):  Jeremy worked a lot with kids while Natalie worked with shut ins
melany (20:46:54 PM):  natalie has the meals experience
melany (20:46:59 PM):  which is a large part of this service
rita (20:47:19 PM):  Well Natalie also worked with the oys and Girls club
luke (20:47:19 PM):  yea i have to look at them again
caroline (20:47:20 PM):  thats very true
caroline (20:47:26 PM):  jeremy has food experience but not the same kind
melany (20:47:46 PM):  yeah natalie's is more appropriate
rita (20:47:52 PM):  Natalie volunteered with the Red Cross ... proves she cares
caroline (20:48:20 PM):  which honestly is really important in this field
caroline (20:48:26 PM):  you need to be caring
luke (20:48:30 PM):  yeaa
rita (20:48:33 PM):  Natalie is the smartie pants one too
rita (20:48:38 PM):  High grades
melany (20:49:03 PM):  hmmm this is a difficult choice
judith (20:49:16 PM):  are we eliminating brian?
rita (20:49:22 PM):  Does anyone think gender matters?
luke (20:49:26 PM):  yea i think they both are better than him
melany (20:49:32 PM):  yeah bye bye brian
julie (20:49:43 PM):  lol yea
melany (20:50:23 PM):  im not sure whether gender matters or not
rita (20:50:26 PM):  Are these elderly in good neighborhoods or bad ... should it be a woman or a man
rita (20:50:49 PM):  perhaps martial arts training
julie (20:50:55 PM):  i guess the gender could matter to the particular adult
judith (20:50:56 PM):  I don't think we should factor in gender
melany (20:50:58 PM):  hmm perhaps a man may be more suitable
judith (20:51:04 PM):  thats illegal
luke (20:51:05 PM):  i dont htink it really matters to much.. i thnk it would just be based on how well they do the job
rita (20:51:19 PM):  but women are more motherly
julie (20:51:20 PM):  agreed
melany (20:51:29 PM):  true. i guess it's kind of like a business neccessity issue if the area is bad. like male bouncers at bars
rita (20:51:30 PM):  k
julie (20:51:30 PM):  lets ignore the sex
melany (20:51:38 PM):  but we dont need to focus on that
luke (20:51:40 PM):  yeaa
caroline (20:52:01 PM):  yea i agree let's ignore it
rita (20:52:20 PM):  Ok - but there is yard work, mowing, shoveling etc
melany (20:52:21 PM):  okay so Jeremy vs. Natalie
julie (20:52:35 PM):  i can do all of that
rita (20:52:46 PM):  I know my husband shivels a much meaner driveway than I do
rita (20:52:52 PM):  * shovels
caroline (20:52:56 PM):  they're applying for it though
caroline (20:52:59 PM):  they know what it entails
melany (20:53:03 PM):  true
julie (20:53:08 PM):  yes
luke (20:53:08 PM):  do u guys think the CPR certfication matters much?
judith (20:53:09 PM):  yea, as long as the prospect knows beforehand what is entiailed
julie (20:53:24 PM):  yes, but it is not required
luke (20:53:40 PM):  yeaa
rita (20:53:54 PM):  What are " errands around the house"?
melany (20:53:59 PM):  yeah it notes how its not needed
luke (20:54:04 PM):  hmm ok
judith (20:54:40 PM):  i woudl think that would mean tidying and whatnot
judith (20:54:46 PM):  maybe change a light bulb if its out, etc..
rita (20:54:50 PM):  The watering garden, shelving etc I guess
julie (20:54:51 PM):  yea
julie (20:54:59 PM):  nothing serious
melany (20:55:02 PM):  that could be applicable to anyone
melany (20:55:04 PM):  i think
rita (20:55:09 PM):  I agree
julie (20:55:10 PM):  agreed
melany (20:55:10 PM):  like anyone would be capable of doing that
julie (20:55:17 PM):  men or women
caroline (20:55:27 PM):  yes
luke (20:55:39 PM):  truee
rita (20:56:12 PM):  Unless one of the candidates is handicapped ... Does the ADA have rules about disclosure on job applications
luke (20:56:32 PM):  i dont know i just keep going back to brian because of the nursing major i feel like that could relate a lot to this job
julie (20:57:11 PM):  it is a nice plus but it is also not required
judith (20:57:25 PM):  yea, i like the nursing major aspect as well
judith (20:57:28 PM):  definitely a big plus
melany (20:57:36 PM):  yeah thats a very good thing to have
luke (20:57:52 PM):  yeaa i think he would be more prepared to jump right into the job
melany (20:58:06 PM):  and it would be great experience for him
melany (20:58:14 PM):  did he graduate yet?
julie (20:58:24 PM):  it doesnt say the person is sick and dying
rita (20:58:27 PM):  Why is brian not looking for a nursing job?
julie (20:58:31 PM):  they just need help around the house
melany (20:58:33 PM):  thats what i was thinking
julie (20:58:35 PM):  anyone can do that
caroline (20:58:39 PM):  i feel as thought the desire to be in the social services field is preperation as well though
melany (20:58:45 PM):  like if he graduated why would he be applying to this
caroline (20:58:47 PM):  anyone can do a lot of these things
melany (20:58:51 PM):  wouldnt he be looking for hospital work?
julie (20:59:12 PM):  he maybe overqualified
melany (20:59:20 PM):  i agree
luke (20:59:23 PM):  well it syas graduation: may 2011
luke (20:59:39 PM):  for brian that is
melany (20:59:43 PM):  oh okay that makes sense then
julie (20:59:45 PM):  that's why jeremy is a perfect fit, especially with his social service background
melany (20:59:48 PM):  he wants to do this before he graduates
rita (20:59:51 PM):  So he would not be committed to staying
luke (21:00:01 PM):  woops wrong person lol sorry
luke (21:00:41 PM):  atleast this one is one that has more than one clear candidate and we can discuss it
rita (21:01:04 PM):  What else should we be looking at
melany (21:01:31 PM):  hmmmm
rita (21:01:42 PM):  we have 29 minutes
melany (21:02:24 PM):  the more i look at the job the more i realize nursing isnt that relevant
melany (21:02:40 PM):  definetly more of a social service job
julie (21:02:57 PM):  yes, i agree
luke (21:02:58 PM):  yea i guess so
caroline (21:03:08 PM):  i agree as well
caroline (21:03:25 PM):  you don't need nursing experience to drive someone around
rita (21:03:34 PM):  "maintain a friendly atmosphere" - what's that about? ... are these elderly belligerent
melany (21:03:54 PM):  hahahhaa
melany (21:04:00 PM):  lets hope not
julie (21:04:00 PM):  hope not
julie (21:04:09 PM):  though most are
judith (21:04:13 PM):  but if something happened it could be helpful
luke (21:04:14 PM):  lol well they probably can be
julie (21:04:37 PM):  i know my grandma is
luke (21:04:59 PM):  ha
rita (21:05:43 PM):  they mention assist in reading ... no one mentioned that as a proficiency - are we to assume...
julie (21:06:09 PM):  they are all in college
rita (21:06:17 PM):  Is this reading like bills, the news or war and peace
rita (21:06:39 PM):  I suppose it could be all of the above
julie (21:06:40 PM):  like read books to them
caroline (21:06:41 PM):  i immediately thought books
melany (21:06:56 PM):  i think books
julie (21:06:57 PM):  at least thats how it is in the movies
melany (21:07:01 PM):  could be anything tho
melany (21:07:05 PM):  yeah i assumed leisure reading
rita (21:07:18 PM):  My Grandfather was all about his computer and email but he was horrible at it ... they don't mention IT help for the elderly
luke (21:07:32 PM):  yea
rita (21:07:46 PM):  I think that might be something they want help with
julie (21:07:53 PM):  maybe
melany (21:08:27 PM):  yeah i think just general tasks
melany (21:08:31 PM):  anyone could be capable of this job
melany (21:08:39 PM):  so who did we decide on?
julie (21:08:46 PM):  jeremy!
judith (21:08:49 PM):  yea def
caroline (21:08:54 PM):  definitely!
luke (21:09:00 PM):  yeaa i go with him as well
melany (21:09:11 PM):  jeremy sounds good to me
caroline (21:09:12 PM):  jeremy
julie (21:09:25 PM):  rita?
rita (21:09:29 PM):  I like Jeremy - but I know luke likes Brian ... I also like NAtalie
julie (21:09:46 PM):  so you chose jeremy?
rita (21:09:57 PM):  sounds good

ariel (10:09:42 AM):  i mean for some people sure... but i never even touch it

cintihia (10:10:01 AM):  everyone is online
josh (10:10:11 AM):  well from reading the directions id have to go with osama bin laden
ted (10:10:23 AM):  right off the bat i will remove lady gaga, and roger federere. they are good in their disciplines and i like them but they are not that influential
ariel (10:11:20 AM):  sorry about that
ariel (10:11:28 AM):  spark messes up sometimes for me ...
ariel (10:11:54 AM):  yeah osama bin laden... definatly is up there unfortunatly
cintihia (10:12:07 AM):  yeah... he actually mihgt take my vote
ted (10:12:08 AM):  you three have the same color, it is difficult to dfferentiante who says what
ariel (10:12:14 AM):  lol
ariel (10:12:16 AM):  sorry
ted (10:12:48 AM):  lets go one by one, yes no?
ariel (10:13:38 AM):  one by one about what?
ariel (10:13:46 AM):  the list?
ariel (10:13:58 AM):  I mean the list is totally unexaustable
ariel (10:14:02 AM):  i could nominate myself
ariel (10:15:22 AM):  josh you alive?
ariel (10:15:29 AM):  you havent said anything this whole time
cintihia (10:15:34 AM):  br right back guys
josh (10:16:22 AM):  i did lol im jus thinking bout the topic
ted (10:16:42 AM):  i have my favorite as most influential
ariel (10:16:50 AM):  who?
ted (10:16:59 AM):  but i want to hear opionions about all
ted (10:17:44 AM):  the google guys. for me are the most influential
ariel (10:17:54 AM):  yeah i was thinking about them
ted (10:18:15 AM):  even bush, or bin laden probably use google in a daily basis
josh (10:18:17 AM):  yea they are one of the ones on top of my list
josh (10:18:28 AM):  but bin laden is my choice
ariel (10:18:44 AM):  i mean hell without google, would wikipedia still be as popular?
ted (10:18:54 AM):  they are not necessarily the most important people in the last 10 years but they are very influential
ariel (10:18:57 AM):  i dont know about you but i feel like that alone is huge
ted (10:19:08 AM):  their decisions impact everybodys life
ariel (10:19:35 AM):  yeah including the horrible icons they sometimes pick to represent the google name...
cintihia (10:19:50 AM):  wat do u mean
ariel (10:20:23 AM):  like... when they have a holiday
ariel (10:20:34 AM):  or something is going on like when the olympics were on this year
ariel (10:20:39 AM):  they change the google icon
ariel (10:20:45 AM):  and i think sometimes its pretty lame
ted (10:20:47 AM):  bin laden is certainly an important figure
ariel (10:21:26 AM):  i think the war... at least for the us has been a very big deal
ted (10:21:34 AM):  but not to everyone in the world
ariel (10:21:43 AM):  i feel like this war has influenced our everyday lives in ways we cannot even begin to comprehend
ariel (10:22:01 AM):  exactly
ted (10:22:08 AM):  that is true ariel
josh (10:22:09 AM):  its says that it especially has to effect the US
cintihia (10:22:15 AM):  which it has
ted (10:22:28 AM):  at the macroeconomic level we cannot comprehend it impact
ted (10:22:51 AM):  because we need a few more years to understand its impacts
josh (10:22:56 AM):  and binladen has impacted alot of the arab world
ariel (10:22:59 AM):  i mean i think it definatly has had an impact if nothing else... then at least on our economy no?
cintihia (10:23:27 AM):  yeah
cintihia (10:23:33 AM):  i mean look at the economy now
cintihia (10:23:34 AM):  its shit
ariel (10:24:00 AM):  if anything i think we should focus on a topic...
ariel (10:24:12 AM):  like i think the economy is aHUGE problem today
ariel (10:24:30 AM):  and if we could come up with the number one person to effect that
ariel (10:24:36 AM):  then... i feel like we have our man
josh (10:24:41 AM):  yea and the US economy affects everyones economy
ted (10:24:54 AM):  chinas economy is better
ariel (10:25:06 AM):  because today all you hear about is the economy... and nothing personal but i know for sure that more than anything in the world right now thats whats effecting me the most
cintihia (10:25:36 AM):  ditto
cintihia (10:25:47 AM):  so who has had the most impact?
ariel (10:26:04 AM):  George Bush?
ariel (10:26:15 AM):  im just throwing that out there... im not solid on that idea
ted (10:26:21 AM):  chenney
ted (10:26:36 AM):  he was more influential than bush
josh (10:27:13 AM):  how so
ted (10:27:24 AM):  bush was only a facade
ted (10:27:57 AM):  i think you have missed the news in the last 10 years
ariel (10:28:28 AM):  LOL
cintihia (10:28:50 AM):  i dont follow u
cintihia (10:28:55 AM):  at all
cintihia (10:29:44 AM):  i dont think chenney ranks anywhere near bin laden
ariel (10:29:44 AM):  me either
josh (10:29:58 AM):  yea me too
ted (10:30:01 AM):  he ranks higher than bush
ted (10:30:09 AM):  i did not say higher than bin laden
cintihia (10:30:43 AM):  but i mean... i dont think chenney has been influential
cintihia (10:30:53 AM):  i havent heard anything crazy about him
cintihia (10:31:07 AM):  oh wait nvm
ted (10:31:16 AM):  nvm?
cintihia (10:31:56 AM):  i get what ur saying
ariel (10:32:25 AM):  i dont
ariel (10:32:45 AM):  i dont watch tv
ariel (10:32:50 AM):  and i dont read the news anywhere
ariel (10:32:51 AM):  lol!
ariel (10:33:21 AM):  yes, yes i live under a rock.... but please explain... how has he been influential
josh (10:34:26 AM):  i think wut hes tryin to say is that chenney was basically the president and bush was jus a face for the presidency
josh (10:34:44 AM):  like cheeneny made the decisions
ted (10:34:45 AM):  just please google most powerful vicepresident ever and you will see what i mean about bush
ted (10:35:32 AM):  josh you got the point
ariel (10:37:09 AM):  i see
ariel (10:37:19 AM):  too much mumbo jumbo for me but i get the idea
ariel (10:37:56 AM):  but do you think cheneny has impacted the world?
josh (10:38:19 AM):  yes
josh (10:38:32 AM):  but i still like bin laden
ariel (10:38:46 AM):  yeah same here
cintihia (10:39:38 AM):  bin laden for president
cintihia (10:39:39 AM):  NOT
ted (10:40:01 AM):  bin laden is my second top choice
ariel (10:40:25 AM):  second top?
ariel (10:40:45 AM):  first is??? oprah?
ted (10:41:19 AM):  for me, the google guys
ted (10:41:34 AM):  i can image my day without google
ariel (10:41:44 AM):  LOL
ariel (10:42:02 AM):  so have we then all agreed to narrow it down to the google guys or bin laden?
josh (10:42:26 AM):  i think so
ted (10:42:51 AM):  i am fine with that
ariel (10:43:19 AM):  cintihia?
cintihia (10:43:31 AM):  idk about the google guys
ariel (10:43:58 AM):  so whos your second choice?
cintihia (10:44:04 AM):  i go on fb 60x more than i do google.and thas no exageratino
cintihia (10:44:10 AM):  im really not sure
cintihia (10:45:23 AM):  i am set on bin laden... but i think there could be a number of people who would fall second
cintihia (10:45:47 AM):  cuz if were gonna think google is number two i think mark zuckerburg is also
ted (10:47:34 AM):  Mark is becoming more and more inflential for sure
ted (10:47:42 AM):  but in the last 10 years
ted (10:47:49 AM):  the google guys top him
ariel (10:48:35 AM):  facebook hasent been around for a decade...
cintihia (10:48:38 AM):  idk... google has offered to buy fb a number of times.. it seems like they want someonthing fb has
cintihia (10:48:46 AM):  its been around for about half of that
josh (10:48:59 AM):  yea im def goin wit bin laden. hes affected our lives in every which way..n with google you dont neccessarily have to us google or anything like that
cintihia (10:49:08 AM):  like i said tho. its started off the social media explosion. without it idk where we would be
cintihia (10:49:43 AM):  everyone is meeting online and even older generations are going into it
cintihia (10:49:54 AM):  my mom and dad have one, my aunt and uncle
cintihia (10:49:59 AM):  who are 70 years old
ariel (10:50:58 AM):  my mom friended me last week...
ariel (10:51:03 AM):  i ignored it...
cintihia (10:51:20 AM):  i ignored them too
cintihia (10:51:32 AM):  everyone wants a piece of facebook
ariel (10:51:34 AM):  lol
ariel (10:51:53 AM):  i dun know i can argue that
ariel (10:52:01 AM):  ive logged in like 2 times in the past 6 months
ariel (10:52:11 AM):  and thats only because something came up in my email lol
josh (10:52:14 AM):  yea but not everyone has it
josh (10:52:23 AM):  or uses it
cintihia (10:52:25 AM):  well u r the exception
cintihia (10:52:29 AM):  lol
cintihia (10:52:37 AM):  facebook is the biggest social media network in the world
cintihia (10:52:59 AM):  im only arguin this because communication is my major and im studying the effects of fb
ariel (10:53:11 AM):  LOL
ted (10:53:31 AM):  facebook is a new medium of comunication
ted (10:53:39 AM):  and it is pervasive
cintihia (10:53:45 AM):  yes
ted (10:53:48 AM):  but for me it is not necesarily influential
cintihia (10:54:04 AM):  how is google influential then... that fb isnt
ted (10:54:21 AM):  or at least not as influential as google
josh (10:54:36 AM):  fastest way to find info
cintihia (10:54:36 AM):  but how so?
ariel (10:54:40 AM):  guys im gonna get a snack im starving
ariel (10:54:42 AM):  brb
ted (10:55:59 AM):  don't get me wrong. i think facebook is really influential
ted (10:56:39 AM):  personally i am not in facebook everyday
ted (10:56:52 AM):  but i use google at least 30 times per day
ted (10:56:57 AM):  and more and more
ted (10:57:34 AM):  before it used to be only searches, then directions, then sharing documents, then google talk, now android os.
cintihia (10:57:47 AM):  wat is android os?
ted (10:58:00 AM):  to use facebook on my phone i use the android os
cintihia (10:58:28 AM):  explain?
ted (10:58:36 AM):  the google operating system that some smart phones have
cintihia (10:59:28 AM):  i dont believe i have that on my blackberry
cintihia (10:59:58 AM):  what does it do for ur phone? like is it faster?
ted (11:00:17 AM):  your blackberry wouldnt have it
ted (11:01:22 AM):  literally i can live without facebook. i can call my friends by phone, and visit them in person. i can belong to groups, and other stuff without it. but i couldn't search the web by myself. and the other search engines do suck

cintihia (11:03:25 AM):  i am
josh (11:03:49 AM):  as am i

ariel (11:12:24 AM):  i vote for bin ladin at #1
ted (11:13:25 AM):  it almost makes me upset that the most influential person is a terrorist
josh (11:13:39 AM):  bin laden has affect everyones life in one way or another tho
ariel (11:13:41 AM):  yeah but its not like we can help it

cintihia (11:18:13 AM):  i cant spend any money
ariel (11:18:15 AM):  well the war

ariel (11:18:26 AM):  i dont know about where you live

cintihia (11:18:50 AM):  ive lost friends in iraq
ted (11:19:21 AM):  the economy is in this bad stituation but not only because of the war
cintihia (11:19:30 AM):  but its a hugeeee reason
ariel (11:19:34 AM):  ive had fellow emts serve and have to kill ppl
cintihia (11:19:35 AM):  pry the number one reason
ariel (11:19:39 AM):  they have never been the same
ted (11:19:54 AM):  the US spends more in welfare that in the war
cintihia (11:20:20 AM):  ok well thats somethinng we have to spend money on
cintihia (11:20:28 AM):  we dont have to spend millions of millions on the war
ted (11:20:31 AM):  i agree
ariel (11:20:36 AM):  yeah but welfare is not centered around one person
ted (11:20:38 AM):  but when you spend more than you have
josh (11:20:42 AM):  but the war also affectt gas prices and everything else
ted (11:20:45 AM):  then is when you go in debt
cintihia (11:20:46 AM):  exactly
ariel (11:21:10 AM):  how about all the people who died in september 11th
ariel (11:21:20 AM):  all of those people have been effected for the past 10 years
ted (11:21:23 AM):  it seemed like the war was driving the was prices up
ted (11:21:37 AM):  but in reality it was the speculators in wall strreet
cintihia (11:22:12 AM):  ok but that was also because of the war
cintihia (11:22:18 AM):  its like a domino effect
ted (11:22:24 AM):  i agree about the deaths, the ones who died in 9 11 and the soldiers
cintihia (11:22:30 AM):  they were overestimating costs on wall street because of the war
ted (11:22:51 AM):  they were not overstimating
ted (11:23:08 AM):  they knew their scheme
ted (11:23:15 AM):  and wanted us to believe it was the war
cintihia (11:23:38 AM):  is that proven
ted (11:23:49 AM):  yup
ted (11:24:06 AM):  when obama was elected and he said we will invextigate

julie (20:00:04 PM):  heyy
leah (20:00:17 PM):  hi
leah (20:00:23 PM):  =)
vicky (20:00:28 PM):  Hi all
rick (20:00:42 PM):  Hey everyone
vicky (20:00:54 PM):  We waiting for anyone else?
moderator (20:00:55 PM):  Hi all, this is moderator. david is supposed to lead today.
moderator (20:01:05 PM):  I request you to wait a few moments.
macy (20:01:45 PM):  Hello...
vicky (20:02:02 PM):  Hi
julie (20:02:50 PM):  does anyone know what the topic is?
rick (20:03:07 PM):  Today's topic will be discuss the declining presence of males in the hard sciences and in professional schools like law and medicine. All fields except business, computer science and engineering are female domidavidd - are there any solutions to this problem? Or is this a problem facing the United States, regardless of gender of students.
leah (20:03:07 PM):  we are waiting for david
moderator (20:03:17 PM):  link
moderator (20:03:32 PM):  link
julie (20:03:40 PM):  thank you
julie (20:03:49 PM):  my link wasn't working
macy (20:03:57 PM):  i had no idea about this idea until reading these 2 articles
macy (20:04:45 PM):  still reading a bit
rick (20:05:01 PM):  same here
moderator (20:05:04 PM):  Hello again. I suppose you can begin now. Please make sure that you reach a consensus at the end.
moderator (20:05:07 PM):  :-)
leah (20:05:14 PM):  okay thanks moderator
julie (20:05:23 PM):  thanks
macy (20:06:01 PM):  so looks like the gender gap has narrowed where women are attending schools and earnging degrees moreso than men'
vicky (20:06:12 PM):  I would like to see the references for that
vicky (20:06:22 PM):  and the exact statistics
vicky (20:06:38 PM):  there is a slightly larger percentage of women in the population, so I would expect to see a slightly larger percentage in school/earning degrees'
vicky (20:06:47 PM):  without statistics I can't really accept that generalization, personally
leah (20:07:21 PM):  though there are more women than men we have to remember that men are the dominant ones in society
vicky (20:07:48 PM):  I wouldn't put it quite that way
macy (20:07:53 PM):  it is quite a generalzation, but i'm looking online and seems that there have been some studies done
vicky (20:08:01 PM):  can you send some links?
vicky (20:08:08 PM):  that's what I'm looking for myself
david (20:08:20 PM):  its not really a generalization, there is a huge amount of data supporting this
julie (20:08:24 PM):  also i believe that since women are so misrepresented that more opportunities are given to women to help with their education, such as grants and scholarships
macy (20:08:28 PM):  link
macy (20:09:02 PM):  david, none of this are familiar with the data and stats so we are currently trying to get up to speed and helping each other with this...
macy (20:09:14 PM):  none of us are familiar.....
david (20:09:43 PM):  link
rick (20:09:55 PM):  I agree with julie, I also believe that women want to prove themselves more in the workplace
julie (20:10:05 PM):  agreed
david (20:10:25 PM):  58 percent of all bachelors degrees to women, 62 percent for associates - and i think the difference is much more pronounced in graduate schools - written write in the above links, it's a reputable source
leah (20:10:31 PM):  yes but just because they want to prove themselves it doesn't mean that they aren't set back
david (20:10:39 PM):  right, but our task is to make recommendations as to possible solutions for the discrepancies
david (20:10:59 PM):  disparities is probably a better word
rick (20:11:31 PM):  The topic is more about the decline in men in X fields
vicky (20:11:32 PM):  57% of women over-all according to that LA times article
david (20:12:01 PM):  okay - so how do we remedy that situation
rick (20:12:08 PM):  incentives
macy (20:12:28 PM):  attract students to college and the professions at earlier ages- could be applied to both men and women i guess
david (20:13:17 PM):  the reason society should be concerned - and a way we can all relate to it - is that the U.S. will fall behind or maybe further behind, other advanced countries in education - leading to a weakened economy, and therefore a weakened military and status / influence
david (20:13:21 PM):  so - incentives
leah (20:13:47 PM):  in elementary school a teacher can bring in different professionals both men and women to show that they too can one day be successful by doing well in school and attending college
david (20:13:59 PM):  what about government programs and scolarships awarded to men?
rick (20:14:09 PM):  can there be incentives for men really? I don not believe that would make to many people happy
leah (20:14:18 PM):  i agree with rick
david (20:14:50 PM):  it's not such a radical idea - considering all the incentives that were given to women - all the female scholarships and title IX to level the playing field and affirmative action for women, which is still todays policy
rick (20:14:50 PM):  I think instead of scholarships their can be informative campaigns
vicky (20:14:54 PM):  from that LA times article
vicky (20:15:03 PM):  a lot of schools are accepting a far greater percentage of males than females
vicky (20:15:09 PM):  to try and keep it roughly 50-50
vicky (20:15:16 PM):  I'd call that an incentive?
david (20:15:42 PM):  here's an article from last week on it, in the nytimes link
rick (20:15:44 PM):  they are making the decision
rick (20:16:05 PM):  I was thinking more of the scholarships for men
david (20:16:09 PM):  no - schools are not accepting more men percentage than women - laurne
david (20:16:19 PM):  your facts are wrong, you need to support your claims
macy (20:16:25 PM):  once kids reach college age and havent been exposed to the opportunities that will be available then there is no point in offering them incentives because they still won't want to better themselves...unless exposed earlier on
david (20:16:31 PM):  vicky - you have the facts opposite
vicky (20:16:49 PM):  hold on I'll find the article again
leah (20:17:17 PM):  A 2007 analysis by U.S. News and World Report, based on the data sent by colleges for the magazine's annual rankings, found that the admissions rate for women averaged 13 percentage points lower than that for men.
david (20:17:18 PM):  i dont think targeting boys in 1st or 2nd grade may be as beneficial as targeting them later, when possible problems develop
vicky (20:17:26 PM):  david: link
vicky (20:17:44 PM):  "In recent years, several college leaders have admitted that their institutions give a boost to male applicants to maintain gender balance on campus. Most students of either sex, they point out, prefer such balance. If Vassar accepted equal percentages of each sex, women would outnumber men by more than 2 to 1."
julie (20:17:46 PM):  i believe this is just an intial spike, soon the ratio between men and women in these fields will even out
rick (20:17:51 PM):  I think that incentives can work at any age
david (20:17:55 PM):  right - so it shows that they are giving a boost to men, accepting men with lower scores
leah (20:18:06 PM):  i think targeting children at younger ages gives them incentive to pursue a career
david (20:18:10 PM):  bc they have to , just to keep things 60 - 40 female male
rick (20:18:25 PM):  is it right that they do that?
macy (20:18:25 PM):  studies indicate that early childhood development is key in the development of a human's potential
vicky (20:18:31 PM):  sorry, what I said was confusing
vicky (20:18:39 PM):  I mean that statistically, more men who apply are accepted
david (20:18:45 PM):  Vassar already is 55-45 female to male ratio
vicky (20:18:47 PM):  not that the total of number of men was greater
vicky (20:18:50 PM):  sorry about that
david (20:19:05 PM):  it wouldnt even out, bc this trend has been publicized for a decade now
julie (20:19:24 PM):  sometimes it takes more then a decade
david (20:19:35 PM):  - No vicky - more men who apply are not accepted
leah (20:19:53 PM):  i think another way to help is to get through the parents since they play a big part in socialization of children as well as development
julie (20:20:06 PM):  maybe some incentives should be made, but not too extreme
vicky (20:20:10 PM):  I'm just going with the statistics in that article david
vicky (20:20:13 PM):  you can check it out if you wish
david (20:20:14 PM):  this is from your article: "There may be no one reason -- or solution. But figuring out ways to help boys achieve in school is a better response to the gender gap than making it easier for them to get into college later."
julie (20:20:16 PM):  men are already "superior"
vicky (20:20:30 PM):  what?
david (20:20:32 PM):  how do you consider men superior?
leah (20:20:35 PM):  i agree with julie
rick (20:20:36 PM):  I think incentives would receive much public outcry
julie (20:20:44 PM):  i agree
leah (20:20:47 PM):  if you look at major companies the majority of CEOs are men
macy (20:20:49 PM):  what kinds of incentives- do we need to have specifics for the outcome of the chat?
leah (20:20:49 PM):  not women
david (20:21:07 PM):  right - well how many of us our CEOs at GE? -- thats a tiny minority of the population
david (20:21:19 PM):  for middle class jobs like doctors and lawyers, its all women in the last ten years
david (20:21:37 PM):  do you know how many doctors and lawyers there are ? countless millions
leah (20:22:04 PM):  and when it comes to wages when comparing men and women with the same degrees men are paid more
david (20:22:05 PM):  How many CEOs are there, how many people do you know who are CEOs and earn 30 million a year? not many
julie (20:22:19 PM):  there are also so many jobs that women don't have, so?
rick (20:22:32 PM):  I heard that women make .75 cents on the dollar that a man makes
leah (20:22:33 PM):  but thats not the point the point is how many women do you really see in power?
david (20:22:38 PM):  not really leah - thats a really out dated model you're using - I can tell you female physicians earn as much as males, thats for sure
vicky (20:22:44 PM):  I have some raw numbers: link
leah (20:23:18 PM):  based on vickys stats it doesn't seem too outdated
david (20:23:21 PM):  we're not looking at power - we're looking at academic achievement, not the tiny minority of people who are executives at ExxonMobil and Texaco
vicky (20:23:55 PM):  those stats are about population, not wages
david (20:24:01 PM):  the link doesnt have anything to do with income or wages
vicky (20:24:32 PM):  right
david (20:24:35 PM):  we're talking about academic achievement - Additionally,the unemployment rate for men is considerably higher than for women
vicky (20:24:40 PM):  here's a more broken-down one link
vicky (20:25:08 PM):  well we're throwing around a lot of generalizations about what the distribution of sexes is in the labor force
macy (20:25:09 PM):  women take lower paying jobs than men overall
vicky (20:25:12 PM):  I thought it would be pertinent
david (20:25:21 PM):  right, so that says men work as carpenters and construction workers
david (20:25:25 PM):  and that women work in offices -
david (20:25:37 PM):  and that in technical services, its distributed evenly
macy (20:25:39 PM):  but in regards to school achievement, we should come up with an idea on how to even out the playing field for men and women
leah (20:26:07 PM):  link
david (20:26:09 PM):  vicky - your data is supporting my claims more than yours - lets focus on solutions
rick (20:26:33 PM):  I would suggest elementary school job exploration days
macy (20:27:01 PM):  good idea rick- i like it
rick (20:27:01 PM):  or learning units
david (20:27:02 PM):  well, first of all - this washington post article is not that relavent - nor does it even have to do with wages
leah (20:27:03 PM):  also workshops to teach parents about what is out there
david (20:27:13 PM):  only with promotions - it doesnt say anything about income
macy (20:27:29 PM):  workshops geared toward parents leah? or helping parents to help their children learn?
david (20:27:32 PM):  also -women have an ability to ascend the social structure that men do not
vicky (20:27:34 PM):  I haven't made any claims, david
vicky (20:27:38 PM):  just trying to find numbers
julie (20:27:45 PM):  men are an employers first choice in most situations, either because of their strength or just because of their lack of family commitments
vicky (20:28:04 PM):  the numbers aren't indicating that julie
david (20:28:43 PM):  women can marry high income earning men - but a male cannot marry a women who earns more money than him, it's just not possible - this is fundamental fact of sociology and American society - so , women have an ability to ascend the social structure , whereas man do not have this option
leah (20:28:44 PM):  helping parents to help their children
macy (20:29:04 PM):  i see leah- that is also a good suggestion, does anyone else like this idea also?
rick (20:29:25 PM):  Yeah, informative sessions for parents would be good
julie (20:29:38 PM):  poor men
david (20:29:41 PM):  Also - women out live men by an average of seven years according to harvard medical school, allowing them to collect more retirment and social security payments
leah (20:29:54 PM):  link
david (20:30:03 PM):  haha, our job is not to feel pity for either gender
julie (20:30:12 PM):  this is true
macy (20:30:13 PM):  informative sessions for parents can be a way to implement......
julie (20:30:16 PM):  i don't
david (20:30:17 PM):  right, i read this artcle already
david (20:30:28 PM):  and it just means that men are marrying wealthier women more than in the past
macy (20:30:31 PM):  job exploration days can be another way to implement....
david (20:30:41 PM):  so more than like 5 out of 100, its now 10 in 100 - you
david (20:30:45 PM):  have to read the whole article
rick (20:30:46 PM):  bring more jobs to the minds of kids instead of doctor, teacher, fireman...
david (20:30:59 PM):  yeah - more job occupations, thats a good idea
leah (20:31:36 PM):  yeah but you said a man cannot marry a woman who earns more money than him
leah (20:31:47 PM):  and i agree with rick
david (20:32:04 PM):  well of course he can, but obviously its just a very small proportion of the population
macy (20:32:15 PM):  i don't think $ is the main issue here, but rather the intellect that we are building in our children for their future..............
rick (20:32:18 PM):  Job Shadowing - perhaps older students (6-12) can join a professional in his or her workplace in a career they are interested in.
david (20:32:29 PM):  i mean how many married couples can you think of, where the man earns less than the women - not a whole lot in comparison to the total
leah (20:32:51 PM):  rick i think it would be a good idea, but then there is a time issue as well as how many people would actually like to participate
david (20:33:03 PM):  yeah, job shadowing is a good idea - def. - it gives ideas and shows the kid their interests and strengths
julie (20:33:04 PM):  then women deserve higher paying jobs, if they earn them
vicky (20:33:16 PM):  looking at numbers again, these graduation statistics are depressing
vicky (20:33:17 PM):  link
leah (20:33:27 PM):  i agree with you david I just don't agree with the fact that they cannot, because like you said they obviously can
vicky (20:33:31 PM):  over-all, 65% of men are graduating versus 72% of women
vicky (20:33:40 PM):  that goes a long way in explaining the college admittance difference
david (20:33:43 PM):  yeah, if u earn a higher paying job then you deserve it - nobodys going to argue with that, its kind of needless to say
rick (20:33:45 PM):  Thats true, time and commitment could be problems, there could maybe be government incentives to invite classes or students into your business
rick (20:34:06 PM):  small business owners I think would like that
leah (20:34:27 PM):  yeah I agree rick maybe small business owners
david (20:34:31 PM):  yeah - if u have boys who cant even graduate high school, then you have a major national problem
vicky (20:34:47 PM):  well, it's everyone
vicky (20:34:51 PM):  only 70% nationally
macy (20:34:54 PM):  very true about decrease in graduation for anyone
david (20:34:56 PM):  yeah - getting students invovled with business - thats a good idea
vicky (20:34:59 PM):  3 of 10 kids won't graduate high school
leah (20:35:07 PM):  or the government can just implement one or two days out of the year in which children can spend a couple of hours with professionals
macy (20:35:12 PM):  a high greaduation rate in the USA is extremely important
david (20:35:22 PM):  well - we're focusing on male versus female - not how graduation rates might or might not be lower than say in the 1970s or something
vicky (20:35:25 PM):  especially figuring out why men are following behind even more than women
david (20:35:27 PM):  yeah, it is important
leah (20:35:30 PM):  but thinking about it, ethics may be involved as well
vicky (20:35:44 PM):  ?
david (20:35:56 PM):  ethics?
leah (20:36:19 PM):  yes ethically would it be okay for a parent to leave their child with an older man/ woman
leah (20:36:39 PM):  would there be a chaperone with each and every child
rick (20:36:40 PM):  There would be protocols
david (20:36:48 PM):  i dont get how its related - but , i think parents should never leave their children with someone unless theyre totally sure the person is okay
rick (20:36:55 PM):  mess up, lose your business
leah (20:36:59 PM):  haha
leah (20:37:01 PM):  good one
rick (20:37:11 PM):  ;-)
david (20:37:34 PM):  yeah - as long as the business owners arent exploiting them - it has to be fair of course - yeah, it would be tough to get that part down
rick (20:37:46 PM):  yeah exploiting the system for $
macy (20:37:56 PM):  well if we're talking about bringing kids into businesses or professions to learn about careers, then obviously it must be chaperoned like go as a class or groups or something
david (20:38:13 PM):  yes, chaperoned is really key
rick (20:38:24 PM):  It could be something like 10 kids a month for a business, put some caps of how many kids can come through
macy (20:38:40 PM):  so is this something for our list of 5 items? what shall we call it-- exploration days?
david (20:38:44 PM):  if they're under 18 especially - what about scholarships for men ? haha, seriously why not
david (20:38:59 PM):  we need 5 items , so far we dont have a lot -
vicky (20:39:08 PM):  I think that focusing on K-12 education would be more important, david
david (20:39:13 PM):  what about - separate classrooms for separate learning styles
vicky (20:39:15 PM):  if they don't graduate they're not applying to college
vicky (20:39:30 PM):  I think exploration days should be included as one of the five, macy
david (20:39:33 PM):  yeah - and then even the ones who do graduate, they have problems too compared to women
vicky (20:39:33 PM):  we all seem to find it useful
macy (20:39:37 PM):  lol right- just one but i think something else was brought up earlier-
rick (20:39:37 PM):  I think that it would work better if kids went individually or in small groups with a parental, a whole class can get kinda hairy
leah (20:39:39 PM):  i think that would be a good idea david
leah (20:39:53 PM):  i think just smaller classroom sizes would be a plus
rick (20:40:02 PM):  "Invite a Student"
david (20:40:13 PM):  i mean, if u count all the men in prison, which out number women more than 99% to 1%, then the unemployment rate for men would be even higher considering the huge amount of prisoners in the u.s. - just to show the full data
vicky (20:40:13 PM):  this has some of the recommendations out there to close the gender gap: link
vicky (20:40:17 PM):  david's idea is on there
julie (20:40:17 PM):  schools should be more involved in medical practices and opening it up to high school students.. when i was in high school i was part of a program called med-tech. It was a medical program where we had a double period including a lab and an intro to college level bio
david (20:40:20 PM):  yeah, no maybe clases by gender
macy (20:40:26 PM):  what about actual classes on school about careers?
vicky (20:40:29 PM):  they're also promoting single-sex schools, and reading assignments more geared towards men
leah (20:40:43 PM):  classes by gender?
vicky (20:40:57 PM):  men-only classes and female-only
macy (20:41:02 PM):  no, not really....but you know how kids are split up for reproductive health many times....
leah (20:41:10 PM):  i think that would leave room for a greater bias
macy (20:41:12 PM):  there could be something about "being the best you can be" academcially
david (20:41:13 PM):  yeah, but this article is already 2 years old - and the data is even stronger now
julie (20:41:47 PM):  genders shouldn't be separated, that could just lead to more problems
david (20:41:48 PM):  no - bc boys need to exert more energy
david (20:41:54 PM):  they take more steps every day than girls
rick (20:41:59 PM):  To much involved in creating separate schools, especially $ wise
leah (20:42:06 PM):  i agree with rick
rick (20:42:18 PM):  plus they need to learn to socialize with girls too
vicky (20:42:18 PM):  I'm not crazy about "separate but equal" either
vicky (20:42:22 PM):  didn't work in the past
david (20:42:24 PM):  but the fact remains, men and women are different - we can't deny that - and so we cant just treat them the same and pretend they are the same
david (20:42:32 PM):  okay, this is not about race though
rick (20:42:32 PM):  no guy would want to go to an all guys school
macy (20:42:37 PM):  arent kids separate in gym class?
david (20:42:43 PM):  yeah, well before theyre 13
macy (20:42:48 PM):  who is talking about separate schools??
vicky (20:42:49 PM):  depends on the school, macy
rick (20:42:56 PM):  I never had separate gym
vicky (20:42:57 PM):  that article I linked to earlier
david (20:43:03 PM):  it wont make a difference, after 12 or 13 - okay then they can go to school with girls
vicky (20:43:06 PM):  was talking about single-sex schools as a solution
leah (20:43:11 PM):  i think they can be treated equally, with the exception of sports
david (20:43:19 PM):  bc the separate classrooms is an idea many of these articles suggest
vicky (20:43:23 PM):  right
vicky (20:43:37 PM):  but when you split kids up
david (20:43:38 PM):  in all these articles, they propose separate classrooms
vicky (20:43:44 PM):  all sorts of issues arise
vicky (20:43:52 PM):  whether it's by gender, race, socioeconomic status, whatever
rick (20:43:53 PM):  ^agreed
david (20:43:53 PM):  theyre already doing it now in a lot of public schools
david (20:44:17 PM):  well - its sort of a progressive idea, but it seems to be gaining traction from what i've read, especially with younger teachers
rick (20:44:27 PM):  so different grading criteria?
vicky (20:44:31 PM):  I'd be interested to see graduation rates of single-sex classrooms vs. mixed
julie (20:44:41 PM):  but creating separate learning environments could lead to a bias
vicky (20:44:45 PM):  yep
leah (20:44:50 PM):  definitely
david (20:44:51 PM):  its going to take a few years for all that data to be ready though
david (20:45:08 PM):  bc theres so much resistance to the idea, that its only on a small scale right now
macy (20:45:09 PM):  this might be where parents need to step in.....if separation at school is not a solution or separate classes, than parents might want to consider making sure their child is reaching their potential and that the boys are reaching and that the girls are reaching, and not "dumbing down"
rick (20:45:14 PM):  i think that solidifies a bias that girls are naturally smarter
vicky (20:45:33 PM):  well smart has very little to do with graduating
vicky (20:45:44 PM):  you don't have to be a rocket scientist to graduate high school, I think it's other social factors
david (20:45:47 PM):  well - the classes would have to be dumbed down, which is a disadvantage to girls
vicky (20:45:58 PM):  I don't think it's that the work is too hard for boys
macy (20:46:04 PM):  right vicky- social factors- like some girls might not want to outsmart boys or vice versa
vicky (20:46:08 PM):  I've never seen a study saying that men are more stupid than women
vicky (20:46:23 PM):  it's about not showing up anymore
rick (20:46:30 PM):  right, priorities
macy (20:46:32 PM):  some boys may think they need to be really active all day long and not pay attention to schooling
leah (20:46:33 PM):  i think a big focus would be location, because students with a lower socioeconomic status maybe be doing more poorly not because they can't excel but because the school doesn't have the funds to provide them with a good education
david (20:46:39 PM):  their intellect is about equal to women - but they dont struggle more to actualize or reach that potential
rick (20:46:57 PM):  there are many variables
julie (20:46:58 PM):  boys just develop slower, and have different priorities during high school
david (20:47:12 PM):  right, but this patterns remains consistent throughout/across various S.E.S. categories
julie (20:47:13 PM):  like sports and girls
david (20:47:48 PM):  boys def. mature slower, so i guess thats accurate - but i mean, in college the boys priority is the same as hs, sports and girls
julie (20:47:49 PM):  but wouldn't say the answer is separate classes, at least not all classes
rick (20:47:55 PM):  so how to keep boys interested in education is the question
leah (20:48:05 PM):  i think separate classrooms based on gender should be a choice
david (20:48:20 PM):  its not a panacea - it doesnt promise to solve all these problems, just offer a part of the solution, theres not going to be one thing that just creates equality
vicky (20:48:58 PM):  I'm against the separation
rick (20:49:09 PM):  Same. More independence in the classroom is a major trend in education.
rick (20:49:21 PM):  Boy could read titles that interest them more
rick (20:49:27 PM):  or write about topics they like
macy (20:49:31 PM):  extracurricular activities might lend a hand regarding gender differences
david (20:49:33 PM):  it's an op-ed, but there are a lot of facts in this:
david (20:49:34 PM):  link
david (20:49:43 PM):  single sex classrooms in public education
david (20:49:50 PM):  it was one of the most searched for topics in Google
macy (20:49:52 PM):  if during the school days there are so many factors preventing the educaiton, maybe there could be other ways to reach boys
julie (20:50:20 PM):  maybe more hands-on work
rick (20:50:38 PM):  Teaching methods need to be addressed to capture boys attention
macy (20:50:40 PM):  provide more reason to be engaged in the work or activity
rick (20:50:45 PM):  hands on yeah
david (20:50:48 PM):  here are some of the reasons behind proposals for single sex classrooms
david (20:50:49 PM):  link
vicky (20:50:53 PM):  I wonder if more male teachers would help?
david (20:50:58 PM):  but yeah, i'd say more hands on , def.
vicky (20:51:00 PM):  there are way more women in education that men
rick (20:51:06 PM):  male teachers are more in demand yeah
vicky (20:51:19 PM):  but it's a circular problem :-\
vicky (20:51:23 PM):  if less men graduate hs
vicky (20:51:25 PM):  and less go to college
vicky (20:51:28 PM):  less will be teachers...
david (20:51:40 PM):  yeah, theyre in demand - partially bc a lot of them cant get jobs - i'm not in education, but i dont think its easy to get a job as a public school teacher in albany area these days, man or woman
macy (20:51:49 PM):  programs like americorp could reach out earlier to boys
vicky (20:52:13 PM):  but that's not about graduating hs
macy (20:52:13 PM):  they are always in need of help
macy (20:52:30 PM):  but its about pointing kids in the right direction like volunteer work
julie (20:52:30 PM):  i think women have just been attracted to more caring and attentive occupations such as doctors, nurses and teachers... somehow we have to make these occupations more appealing to men
david (20:52:32 PM):  the education gap favors men
leah (20:52:38 PM):  i liked the learning styles idea.. because learning depends on the individual.. if we just group boys who's to say that they are all going to excel
vicky (20:52:51 PM):  agreed, leah
david (20:52:54 PM):  so hopefully the men will continue to fall behind, just way behind
vicky (20:53:04 PM):  what?
rick (20:53:10 PM):  ?
leah (20:53:11 PM):  ?
david (20:53:12 PM):  and then this will give men more selection and more choices in terms of women - so basically
david (20:53:32 PM):  it favors men - bc then they can choose women who are more accomplished than them
macy (20:53:53 PM):  i am more accomplished than my guy- higher earning as well
macy (20:53:58 PM):  ;)
leah (20:54:03 PM):  haha
julie (20:54:10 PM):  lol
macy (20:54:30 PM):  i told him about this topic and he loves the fact that i'm "higher up"
david (20:54:31 PM):  yeah, thats what i mean - thats why its good for guys - thats becoming more common , i dont know about marriage that way, although apparently thats changeing too, but def. relationships too
david (20:54:39 PM):  yeah
rick (20:54:50 PM):  social norms changing
vicky (20:54:58 PM):  I don't see aiming at lower accomplishment/education as a good thing
david (20:55:02 PM):  yeah, slowly
macy (20:55:19 PM):  i just think that people have more opportunity to pursue what they like rather than what society tells them to pursue
rick (20:55:22 PM):  more educators in the schools, more attention for students, keep their attention
rick (20:55:28 PM):  more jobs created
rick (20:55:42 PM):  government subsidized
david (20:55:49 PM):  yeah - more options maybe now - or maybe norms are changing real fast, in a lot of ways they are actually
julie (20:55:50 PM):  so what are the 5 specific things we are implementing to change this problem?
vicky (20:55:53 PM):  I think we have 3 things so far for our list that we've agreed on?
vicky (20:55:57 PM):  more educators
david (20:56:05 PM):  we could say single sex classrooms, but that we didn't all agree on it
macy (20:56:06 PM):  list the 3 please : )
vicky (20:56:08 PM):  individualized instruction - possibly by gender, possibly by learning style
julie (20:56:11 PM):  yes please
david (20:56:13 PM):  just that it 's a possible idea
rick (20:56:13 PM):  more teachers, TA's and support staff
vicky (20:56:14 PM):  and the career day
david (20:56:16 PM):  or different learning styles
julie (20:56:32 PM):  so we have 4?
david (20:56:33 PM):  like more hands on activities where you can run or burn off energy in the classroom
leah (20:56:42 PM):  different learning styles, did we agree on bringing student to a workplace?
julie (20:56:45 PM):  yes, hands on ... i agree
macy (20:56:51 PM):  yes, workplace
vicky (20:56:53 PM):  I think so, leah
julie (20:56:53 PM):  yes
rick (20:56:54 PM):  yeah
leah (20:57:10 PM):  so do we have the five?
julie (20:57:15 PM):  i think so
david (20:57:16 PM):  yes, students should find positive role models - that whole thing, it sounds very corny - but its proly good at a young age
rick (20:57:22 PM):  yup
vicky (20:57:24 PM):  I think I see 4, including hands-on activities
david (20:57:34 PM):  so introducing students to people who have jobs and are willing to show them what its like
david (20:57:37 PM):  a little bit
leah (20:58:20 PM):  yea a little bit
rick (20:58:25 PM):  Maybe there can be clubs sponsored in each community that support good values such as education and hard work
rick (20:58:37 PM):  keep boys on the straight and narrow
macy (20:58:45 PM):  that is what i was going for earlier with extracurriculiar activities-
macy (20:58:53 PM):  volunteering, etc
rick (20:58:56 PM):  sponsered to they can do and buy cool things
rick (20:59:12 PM):  s*ponsored
david (20:59:17 PM):  yeah, thats what sports can do - and other things, a lot of things can cultivate various interests
macy (20:59:27 PM):  sports yes
vicky (20:59:32 PM):  I think there's already a huge emphasis on male sports
vicky (20:59:37 PM):  that doesn't seem to be helping so far
rick (20:59:42 PM):  sports are already here
rick (20:59:45 PM):  right
david (20:59:46 PM):  but i think more male teachers would be a good idea too, i'm not saying it has to be fifty - fifty, but just more male teachers than there are now might help
leah (20:59:48 PM):  yea i agree
macy (20:59:57 PM):  well as far as teamwork and having goals are concerned
leah (21:00:02 PM):  yea maybe positive male role models
rick (21:00:07 PM):  there is no way legislation is going to be passed for more male teacher incentives
david (21:00:20 PM):  yeah, def. not
rick (21:00:24 PM):  incentives to become teachers would work
david (21:00:28 PM):  but in public schools now, from what i hear
david (21:00:36 PM):  of course teaching math in science puts you in real high demand, but
leah (21:00:37 PM):  yea definitely incentives
vicky (21:00:42 PM):  it's such a no-no to admit to an incentive for males
rick (21:00:44 PM):  male or female there is more attention paid to each student
david (21:00:52 PM):  especially in elementary schools, theyre really desperate for male teachers
vicky (21:01:04 PM):  I don't see why they couldn't recruit actively
leah (21:01:10 PM):  i think a major problem in teaching is not that many people want to become teachers because of the money factor
vicky (21:01:16 PM):  I think it's more fair to say "we need to train more male teachers"
vicky (21:01:21 PM):  than to let 10 people interview
david (21:01:23 PM):  and they hire them - so legislation or not, bc there are no male teachers, some of them get hired - kind of like how there used to be no female attorneys and they got hired
vicky (21:01:26 PM):  and hire the man just because
vicky (21:01:44 PM):  that's true leah
rick (21:01:45 PM):  increase teacher salaries - govnm't can bump them up or something with legislation maybe
david (21:01:48 PM):  well - yeah, its called affirmative action - so right now , we hire women if the qualifications are equal
david (21:01:57 PM):  legislation, affirmative action was legislated
david (21:02:04 PM):  and its for women, its the law
vicky (21:02:10 PM):  but onyly for women and people of color
david (21:02:14 PM):  SUNY Albany is an affirmative action employer
vicky (21:02:15 PM):  which is wrong
julie (21:02:23 PM):  i agree, more male teachers
vicky (21:02:26 PM):  it should be for any underrepresented population
vicky (21:02:37 PM):  whether it means men in women-domidavidd professions, or women in men-domidavidd professions
david (21:02:41 PM):  i dont know if its wrong, but i think in terms of gender, it might have to be re-evaluated - not for people of color though, theyre still really under-represented
vicky (21:02:41 PM):  mix it all up!
leah (21:02:50 PM):  i agree with david
david (21:02:59 PM):  yeah, it should be mixed up and flexible
rick (21:03:13 PM):  how do you get more male teachers?
vicky (21:03:15 PM):  talking about race is a whole different can of worms
leah (21:03:15 PM):  definitely more flexible
vicky (21:03:21 PM):  that article I found about graduation rates was shocking
vicky (21:03:34 PM):  I'd like to find more recent graduation stats though, that was from 2003
david (21:03:43 PM):  its worse -
david (21:03:52 PM):  i'll try to find something more recent
julie (21:05:18 PM):  i guess it comes down to, how will having more men teaching help men enter professional schools such as medicine and law?
vicky (21:05:25 PM):  link
vicky (21:05:37 PM):  it's a survey of 94-2007, that's a bit better
vicky (21:05:52 PM):  off topic though : x
leah (21:06:13 PM):  going back to sports i think there should be less of a focus on the sport itself and more focus on class room performance.. and raising the bar when it comes to who can play and can't play due to academics
rick (21:06:17 PM):  more men teachers, more role models for boys, they stay interested in their education, then have greater opportunity because they stayed in school...theoretically
leah (21:06:39 PM):  instead of having to keep a 75 average for example maybe keep an 80-85
leah (21:06:58 PM):  not sure if that was too out of left field haha
julie (21:07:16 PM):  lol
rick (21:07:17 PM):  i see what you mean
vicky (21:07:23 PM):  I'd be happy to see more kids graduating
julie (21:07:23 PM):  i agree
vicky (21:07:28 PM):  better academics would be nice too
rick (21:07:34 PM):  that would only really affect the people who are already in sports
rick (21:07:51 PM):  the majority of a school is not into sports
vicky (21:08:12 PM):  true
leah (21:08:27 PM):  yea but it would affect those who are trying to get into sports which is usually alot.. depending on how many extracurricular's the school has
julie (21:08:55 PM):  i feel like maybe raising the standards would hurt more men then help
rick (21:08:56 PM):  so more sports teams?
julie (21:09:08 PM):  we need to fix their performance levels first
leah (21:09:08 PM):  i didnt think about that but yeah
david (21:09:09 PM):  yeah - raising standards is good - but it might be too unobtainable
macy (21:09:12 PM):  why more sports teams?
david (21:09:23 PM):  maybe raising standards -
julie (21:09:25 PM):  and sports doesn't help
rick (21:09:33 PM):  maybe like school rec teams in addition to the formal school team
david (21:09:37 PM):  but maybe not too - sports teams, have to be equal
david (21:10:05 PM):  if you add a womens sports team, its the law to add one more for men,and vice versa - TITLE IX - more sports teams cant hurt, provided u have the funds
david (21:10:14 PM):  and its not taken from more scholastic programs
leah (21:10:34 PM):  right funding is usually a problem
julie (21:10:37 PM):  i feel like sports takes away from learning
rick (21:10:48 PM):  funding...ugh
rick (21:10:52 PM):  :-p
leah (21:10:53 PM):  lol rick
vicky (21:10:54 PM):  hahaha
vicky (21:11:01 PM):  better funding = #5
vicky (21:11:03 PM):  :)
david (21:11:04 PM):  how does it take away from learning?
julie (21:11:05 PM):  maybe more funding can be a solution
leah (21:11:15 PM):  yea i dont think it takes away from learning
julie (21:11:35 PM):  how does it help men enter health fields?
leah (21:11:37 PM):  i think it would give more incentive to learn and to perform better that way you can actually play
david (21:11:37 PM):  yeah - well more funding - if u live in a wealthy area and the taxes are high or if your parents send you to a great private school, but otherwise - more funding isnt always an option
rick (21:11:49 PM):  the govnmt could put so much money from the war into better uses, like education
david (21:11:54 PM):  yeah
david (21:11:56 PM):  definitely
rick (21:12:06 PM):  >:o
leah (21:12:09 PM):  haha
leah (21:12:32 PM):  what about charter schools?
david (21:12:48 PM):  instead, we're being taxed to pay for soldiers to murder people over seas, thats what we're paying for - instead of being taxed to finance education and health care, we're being taxed so the government can spend billlions of dollars to murder people that i proly will never see and dont even care about
david (21:13:05 PM):  lets get focused
rick (21:13:07 PM):  exactly
leah (21:13:13 PM):  it could raise the performance of teachers and that could raise the performance of students
rick (21:13:21 PM):  chat hijack
leah (21:13:24 PM):  haha
david (21:13:32 PM):  wow , its so easy to get off topic here, my bad - its not real appropriate - but in terms of funding, one of our solutions
rick (21:13:38 PM):  haha
julie (21:13:43 PM):  im going to list some of the ideas we have and everyone can say whether they agree or not
julie (21:13:46 PM):  1. hands-on activities 2. workplace (internships?) 3. more male teachers 4. extracurricular activities 5. gender-specific learning skills
david (21:13:54 PM):  could be to divert money to education from military or sometihng like that, wherever you want to take it from
macy (21:14:10 PM):  good- there are 5
rick (21:14:11 PM):  the govnmt moving some financials around, reprioritization!
leah (21:14:19 PM):  yea but i dont think that will happen david... we are soooo big on our military
rick (21:14:29 PM):  yeahhhh...
vicky (21:14:31 PM):  I'm not sure about #5 julie
david (21:14:41 PM):  yeah, thats a great list julie - its not super specific - in terms of 4, but i could've contributed there and i didnt
vicky (21:14:46 PM):  maybe differentiated learning, but I think splitting things by gender is off-track
leah (21:14:50 PM):  not gender specific just learning skills in general
david (21:14:51 PM):  what do we mean extracurricular activities
vicky (21:15:04 PM):  I think that was the idea for more sports?
rick (21:15:08 PM):  Perhaps making the school more than just schoo
vicky (21:15:09 PM):  I'm not down with that one either
rick (21:15:10 PM):  school
david (21:15:18 PM):  nobody likes the idea of single sex classrooms? its just for one or two classes of the day when you're like eight years old
leah (21:15:18 PM):  yeah rick
vicky (21:15:18 PM):  if kids don't want to show up
rick (21:15:19 PM):  more than sports too
vicky (21:15:23 PM):  they don't want to stay longer than they have to
julie (21:15:33 PM):  well we can make it more specific, i was just seeing if everyone was on the same page
rick (21:15:38 PM):  but what if there was interesting stuff to do
rick (21:15:46 PM):  instead of just class
leah (21:15:48 PM):  i think maybe gym can be gender specific lol
vicky (21:16:12 PM):  there would be a survey of at-risk boys
david (21:16:15 PM):  yeah, thats why classes are broken up - there is some music education, physical education, etc
vicky (21:16:16 PM):  asking them what would make them stay in school
vicky (21:16:20 PM):  *should not would
vicky (21:16:38 PM):  all at-risk kids, really
rick (21:17:00 PM):  In my school I was the last class to use the wood shop, that was the coolest (and most dangerous) class ever. If there was more practical, hands on learning mixed in boys might feel motivated to stay.
leah (21:17:04 PM):  yeah but also i think there are certain girls and guys who prefer maybe a more sport oriented gym class or a less sport oriented gym class
david (21:17:34 PM):  you can do both for gym - it doesnt have to be sport oriented
david (21:17:40 PM):  it should be both
vicky (21:17:49 PM):  I think hands-on would make a lot of kids more interested rick
vicky (21:17:51 PM):  not just boys
rick (21:18:04 PM):  but boys would be affected
vicky (21:18:07 PM):  definitely
leah (21:18:11 PM):  agreed
vicky (21:18:12 PM):  I just wouldn't qualify it by gender
rick (21:18:13 PM):  its hard to narrow the scope to just boys
julie (21:18:26 PM):  yes
leah (21:18:28 PM):  definitely is
vicky (21:18:34 PM):  I think that something would promote learning/staying in school in general
david (21:18:37 PM):  yeah - but theres evidence that they just are more active, theyre more physical
vicky (21:18:39 PM):  would count if it also influenced boys
david (21:18:43 PM):  its just a fact
vicky (21:18:56 PM):  I think it's a stereotype david
vicky (21:19:00 PM):  but that's a long story
vicky (21:19:07 PM):  about socialization and sexism
david (21:19:29 PM):  well, there are some boys who are not active - and whether its through socialization or biology or a combination, girls are less active
vicky (21:19:41 PM):  using your argument
vicky (21:19:48 PM):  boys are just going to graduate less
david (21:19:48 PM):  and boys are more - we're not going to have the power to change society, people coform to gender stereotypes
vicky (21:19:50 PM):  because they already do
david (21:19:52 PM):  *conform
david (21:20:05 PM):  yeah - but the state's role
david (21:20:45 PM):  is to be secular, to be committed to equality , etc. - and we've seen this time and time again, the state is far reaching - how many billions of dollars did the state spend to advance women in the 1980s and 1990s
david (21:20:56 PM):  so its certainly not unprecendented
rick (21:21:02 PM):  Alright so we're at what will keep boys interested in school.
julie (21:21:02 PM):  so the more extracurricular activities can be attending more sports?
rick (21:21:03 PM):  More chances at physical activity and more hands on learning.
david (21:21:04 PM):  it would just be unprecennted for boys
david (21:21:36 PM):  its still a radical idea for boys, but i really dont think white women are minorities any more -they have opportunity
julie (21:22:10 PM):  lets stay focus, this isn't about race
david (21:22:10 PM):  okay - so back on track here - how about more physical activity as an option for either gender - you can always opt out -
leah (21:22:13 PM):  lol
julie (21:22:24 PM):  agree
david (21:22:26 PM):  i'm sure more girls than boys will opt out, but we can just give them a chocie
david (21:22:29 PM):  choice
rick (21:22:31 PM):  I say more interesting classes and physical activity
leah (21:22:40 PM):  yea definitely
rick (21:22:43 PM):  interjected between math, science, etc
david (21:23:10 PM):  yeah, good idea
julie (21:23:14 PM):  so we'll add physical activity to the list?
leah (21:23:35 PM):  i would think so
david (21:23:36 PM):  yeah, def. - why not - it could even be experimental
david (21:23:50 PM):  it should be tried though, the idea has enough support to try i think
julie (21:24:03 PM):  ok, so now gender specific learning.. maybe we can be more specific
vicky (21:24:27 PM):  I still disagree with that
rick (21:24:39 PM):  I think of gender specific learning, students should take charge of their own learning
rick (21:24:46 PM):  individualized learning
julie (21:24:50 PM):  ok so we have one more issue
rick (21:24:57 PM):  possible with some subjects
david (21:24:58 PM):  at 7 or 8 years old, u dont have initiative to take charge of your learning
leah (21:24:59 PM):  i disagree w/ gender specific learning as well
rick (21:25:09 PM):  I mean give students decisions
vicky (21:25:20 PM):  "authentic learning"
rick (21:25:22 PM):  its as easy as choosing a book to read instead of doing a class book
vicky (21:25:39 PM):  more real-life scenarios and choice
vicky (21:25:51 PM):  I think that's effective for all kids regardless of gender
david (21:25:52 PM):  so a grade schooler is intelligent and experienced enough for that decision? its okay to go with what they like, but a lot of things have to be decided for them -
vicky (21:26:02 PM):  well of cousre
vicky (21:26:03 PM):  *course
david (21:26:09 PM):  yeah, choosing a book or class work
vicky (21:26:10 PM):  but give them a range of choices
david (21:26:12 PM):  that is a good example
david (21:26:13 PM):  yeah
rick (21:26:17 PM):  You give them decisions out of a set
vicky (21:26:18 PM):  instead of saying "read this. write that."
rick (21:26:23 PM):  never free reign
david (21:26:25 PM):  a range of choices - yeah, thats a good idea
julie (21:26:38 PM):  ok i think we got it!
rick (21:26:42 PM):  haha their still has to be a teacher
david (21:26:42 PM):  but also - just to be practical - some things have to be universal , and standards met
leah (21:26:44 PM):  definitely a range of choices is an awesome idea
rick (21:26:53 PM):  yeahhhh
david (21:27:01 PM):  so i think gender specific is good, but its debatable among the group -
david (21:27:11 PM):  so we can just say a range of choices as the final
david (21:27:17 PM):  point on the list
rick (21:27:19 PM):  I agree
leah (21:27:22 PM):  agreed
julie (21:27:58 PM):  1. hands-on activities 2. workplace (internships?) 3. more male teachers 4. extracurricular activities- more physical activity 5. range of choices- more individuation
vicky (21:28:18 PM):  works for me
leah (21:28:18 PM):  yeap
macy (21:28:22 PM):  sure
david (21:28:25 PM):  this is proly not even my real first name i'm using. great list though! excellent work, thanks for compiling that julie
rick (21:28:28 PM):  sounds good
david (21:28:40 PM):  awesome - its complete
rick (21:28:51 PM):  Let the change begin
leah (21:28:56 PM):  yeap

george (8:11:42 PM):  couldn't find video of it :(  looks like they are cracking down on that kind of stuff now
george (8:11:59 PM):  hard to find music videos nowadays too
jordan (8:12:11 PM):  can't imagine people delight in watching other people fight to each other to death.
george (8:12:29 PM):  it's glorious!
nick (8:12:38 PM):  yeah, sports events are probably very copyrighted
jordan (8:12:46 PM):  really? u mean boxing?
george (8:13:06 PM):  you can't imagine yourself ko'ing a lady and then having your hand raised in sweet victory, jordan?  :P

amy (8:23:14 PM):  yes, me too
nick (8:23:31 PM):  yes, I disocvered the secret - resizing the window!
nick (8:23:33 PM):  :)
michelle (8:23:35 PM):  Has anybody used second life before? I assume most of us used skype, am I right?
mara (8:23:36 PM):  i agree
mara (8:23:52 PM):  i really enjoyed the women who filed for divorce because of internet infidelity
amy (8:23:53 PM):  no, i have not used either
mara (8:24:01 PM):  i never use either..
nick (8:24:14 PM):  i have poked around in Second Life and find it kinda pointless
mara (8:24:15 PM):  but i know people who use skype weekly
michelle (8:24:15 PM):  what do you mean, nick, resize it to a smaller size?
amy (8:24:23 PM):  that was crazy- i mean the stuff that is happening
george (8:24:25 PM):  i know what skype is, but never used it...i have used ventrilo tho
john (8:24:27 PM):  maybe i think we have start the topic alittit bit last night
amy (8:24:35 PM):  is skype like a webcam?
jordan (8:24:55 PM):  I use skype almost every day.
amy (8:24:59 PM):  you are right john- we did start it a little
michelle (8:25:08 PM):  skype is like msn, call, chat...
nick (8:25:08 PM):  the problem i was having was just seeing a blank grey screen with no chat widnow - but it turns out i needed to click the "maximize" button to see it
nick (8:25:15 PM):  this was not obvious at all :)
john (8:25:17 PM):  I never use it
mara (8:25:23 PM):  my friends that studied abroad use skype to keep in touch with the people they met there
jordan (8:25:24 PM):  the world appears so small.
mara (8:25:44 PM):  ugh me too nick... glad i know that now haha
amy (8:25:54 PM):  so skype is used for people who want to communicate but also want to see each other??
mara (8:26:01 PM):  global communication
jordan (8:26:05 PM):  you hear, see and even feel each other with skype
nick (8:26:26 PM):  i have not used skype either, but i know it is popular
jordan (8:26:31 PM):  are we advertise skype?
michelle (8:26:42 PM):  I think a lot issues surrounding the virtual world, like trust, socialzing, how technology can support the way people communicate in a real way
george (8:26:45 PM):  i have a lot of friends that use itouch
john (8:26:54 PM):  i know a little bit
mara (8:27:02 PM):  feel?
nick (8:27:17 PM):  tactile chat LOL
george (8:27:19 PM):  one of them pretends to be a lesbian and gets nude photos from girls all over the country...i bet some of them are guys pretending to be lesbians too
jordan (8:27:20 PM):  what about using internet for shopping?
michelle (8:27:24 PM):  What do you think about the virtual world? ANy pros and cons?
mara (8:27:25 PM):  lol
jordan (8:27:48 PM):  mara wants to know how we feel by skype?
mara (8:27:50 PM):  or guys trying to pick lesbians up... ugh-oh :P
nick (8:28:08 PM):  like i said, i think Second Life is pointless - it seems like a fad that will die out
mara (8:28:11 PM):  yeah feel through skype? what?
michelle (8:28:11 PM):  internet for shopping can be in virtual world too......? maybe? any confirmation?
jordan (8:28:19 PM):  not only that mara
amy (8:28:27 PM):  yeah i wondered the same thing-  i figured it was a joke
george (8:28:34 PM):  hehe
jordan (8:28:51 PM):  what? what's a joke?
amy (8:29:00 PM):  yeah- shopping is a virtual thing too-  people might be buying more online thatn they ever would in person
jordan (8:29:03 PM):  im a bit confused by so many voices.
mara (8:29:10 PM):  nick... i think that you might be right but some people need emotional attachments like that site allows for ya know?
michelle (8:29:10 PM):  nick, I just joined a seminar in second life... it seems that a lot of researchers in cs, ece, social science are either using second life as a tool to do research or teaching
amy (8:29:10 PM):  see, hear, and feel thorugh skype??
george (8:29:27 PM):  hey that can be a new business...selling force feedback devices for internet communication
jordan (8:29:30 PM):  waaaa. I can't follow
mara (8:29:42 PM):  yeah i get the see and hear part but WTH... how do you feel?
george (8:29:45 PM):  communicate intimacy with force feedback!
john (8:30:12 PM):  i like do shopping online
george (8:30:18 PM):  what do you feel through skype?
jordan (8:30:27 PM):  a future thing. likely to come very soon. I mean "feel"
mara (8:30:31 PM):  yes... please someone lol
amy (8:30:41 PM):  and i think smell is on the way also
mara (8:30:46 PM):  i still dont get it..
jordan (8:30:52 PM):  sure.
mara (8:30:52 PM):  what?
mara (8:30:53 PM):  haha
nick (8:30:57 PM):  michelle - yes, but do regular users really want to use Second Life for anything serious?
george (8:31:16 PM):  maybe you put on a special shirt so i can "touch" your shoulder through the internet
mara (8:31:23 PM):  this is crazy talk.. its technology not like pleasentville where we can go through the computer and stuff
jordan (8:31:23 PM):  People 50 years ago could not imagine us seeing each other from a distance.
michelle (8:31:28 PM):  I personally did not use it before.
nick (8:31:47 PM):  george, you are an agent of chaos
amy (8:31:59 PM):  so do you guys think these new activities are good for us or bad or indifferent??
michelle (8:32:01 PM):  nick, many of my colleagues in other universities are considering to teach fully online course using second life
mara (8:32:02 PM):  im guessing yes nick, because how could it be grounds for divorce otherwise...?
george (8:32:13 PM):  that's why we gotta start a business mara selling these tactile devices!
mara (8:32:16 PM):  something that starts on the internet can lead to face-to-face contact ya know?
michelle (8:32:21 PM):  I agree, george,,,,,,,,:-)
mara (8:32:32 PM):  WEIRD haha george
john (8:32:41 PM):  yes
nick (8:32:43 PM):  That article about the divorce was sad ...
jordan (8:32:45 PM):  we are told the internet draws people close together, but I think otherwise.
amy (8:33:09 PM):  i somewhat agree jordan...
mara (8:33:20 PM):  amy.. i think they are both good and bad, but its going to be different for each person and how they use it to be clear on that answer
amy (8:33:28 PM):  doesnt spending so much time online take real life time away from families?
jordan (8:33:33 PM):  with internet, people are becoming too lazy to come to yoiur house to see u.
nick (8:33:33 PM):  This was the saddest part: "Online, Laura Skye works as a club DJ and is 6 feet tall, weighs 112 lb. and has a penchant for skin-tight cowgirl outfits. In reality, Taylor, an unemployed former waitress, is 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighs 224 lb. and prefers T shirts and leggings. "
john (8:33:34 PM):  draw people close in virtul world
michelle (8:33:36 PM):  DO you think the divorce thing from the article is generalizable to others? I don't think so...
amy (8:33:40 PM):  true mara
george (8:34:02 PM):  "oh i had a tough day at work"  "put on that tactile shirt from george-mara-michelle company!"  "ok" *massage* "ahhh"
michelle (8:34:06 PM):  amy, I agree with you.
john (8:34:09 PM):  turu michelle
mara (8:34:11 PM):  im doing research right now on infidelity and i have come across a lot of articles about internet infidelity so that article was very interesting to me
amy (8:34:15 PM):  i think that there are many marital problems because of online activities
amy (8:34:42 PM):  what have you learned mara-  anything you want to share?
nick (8:34:42 PM):  only some personalities are so attracted to online relationships
mara (8:34:57 PM):  lol george
jordan (8:34:58 PM):  you mean extra-marrital because of the use of internet?
michelle (8:35:09 PM):  mara, share something with us, please...?
george (8:35:16 PM):  if they never meet in real life, can you consider internet flirting to be infidelity?
john (8:35:17 PM):  yes, even for doing research
mara (8:35:18 PM):  well mainly that they are still trying to figure out what counts as internet infidelity
amy (8:35:39 PM):  no extramarital necessarily0  just taking time away from being with each other like going outside or something
george (8:35:54 PM):  that's almost like getting mad at a guy for reading playboy
michelle (8:35:56 PM):  Can we say they trust Internet very much so they choose their spose from Internet?
jordan (8:35:57 PM):  internet flirting can lead to face-to-face rendesvouz.
mara (8:36:03 PM):  they have been also comparing genders... trying to put women in the usual emotional category and men in the sexual, but they have failed over and over again to claim that
amy (8:36:07 PM):  well what is infiedlity -  to back up a bit   mara
george (8:36:13 PM):  the guy doesn't even know if the other side is a real woman on the internet!!!
amy (8:36:31 PM):  lol  george  so true
john (8:36:34 PM):  i agree with michelle
michelle (8:36:47 PM):  george, I think virtual world is different here. You can SEE and FEEL and it can be live
jordan (8:36:47 PM):  well, with skype, you see each other. george
mara (8:36:52 PM):  also, they have found that almost all internet relationships have lead to face-to-face contact and something more serious which leads their intimate partners to want divorce or to break up..
george (8:37:10 PM):  oh ok like webcam stuff
nick (8:37:15 PM):  almos all? really?
mara (8:37:17 PM):  indidelity is a violation of relationship norms or rules
john (8:37:28 PM):  i think you can do every thing through internet
amy (8:37:32 PM):  Doesnt spending so much time online mean that there is a reason why you dont want to be with your spouse instead?
jordan (8:37:42 PM):  anyway, if one wants a divorce, he can find ways. How can we blame internet
mara (8:37:57 PM):  they say 84% in three articles
amy (8:38:05 PM):  gotcha mara-  so it might be emotional stuff why the spouse chooses the internet  over the spouse
michelle (8:38:11 PM):  jordan, good point.
john (8:38:21 PM):  hha
mara (8:38:21 PM):  right
amy (8:38:31 PM):  internet is sooooo easy though
amy (8:38:36 PM):  its an escape from reality
mara (8:38:42 PM):  the internet isnt to blame... the behavior is to blame
amy (8:38:46 PM):  so not to deal with problems
michelle (8:38:47 PM):  but addictive to Internet might be different
nick (8:38:49 PM):  Personally, i think that a person who marries someone's avatar online already has relationship issues in the real world that they are avoiding through escapism
george (8:38:53 PM):  now we just have to figure out a way to get those internet cheating guys to wear our tactile mask so their wives can slap them through the internet!
jordan (8:39:00 PM):  right, mara
mara (8:39:03 PM):  and there is very few ways of hiding it anymore... like moderator said wheres the privacy?
amy (8:39:07 PM):  but the internet is at our fingertips whereas going outside to have an affair would take more planning
nick (8:39:16 PM):  *slaps george*
mara (8:39:21 PM):  aha nick
jordan (8:39:25 PM):  if addicted, one gets totally a slave
amy (8:39:56 PM):  yes nick
george (8:40:02 PM):  *cries*
george (8:40:14 PM):  oh wait, i have to put the mask on for that to work
jordan (8:40:19 PM):  privacy seems obsolete now.
mara (8:40:23 PM):  right amy and some people are scared of that kind of commitment so they build it on the internet and it makes it easier to continue outside
john (8:40:33 PM):  private information
jordan (8:40:53 PM):  do u still have privacy?
michelle (8:41:03 PM):  maybe
amy (8:41:08 PM):  privacy for what?
jordan (8:41:11 PM):  you know man search?
mara (8:41:21 PM):  on websites like myspace and facebook you can change your privacy settings
jordan (8:41:25 PM):  personal privay
john (8:41:27 PM):  i mean we should protect our information
mara (8:41:30 PM):  so there is some loopholes,
jordan (8:41:48 PM):  other people can get all information about you if they want
amy (8:41:53 PM):  people dont seem to want privacy bc they "friend" people they dont even really know and then share all their stuff with them anyway
john (8:41:57 PM):  sure
mara (8:42:08 PM):  if you want them too jordan... but you can hide things from certain peopel
george (8:42:26 PM):  the only safe way of protecting your information on the internet is to never use your info on there in the first place
mara (8:42:34 PM):  right.. well thats just dumb haha i dont friend people i dont know
jordan (8:42:35 PM):  internet may betray
mara (8:42:50 PM):  and the whole app. "you may know these people because they know your friends" is crazy
amy (8:42:57 PM):  but you see these people with like 300 friends or more
george (8:43:02 PM):  if you want to do online shopping, make a small bank acct. that has a limited supply of money so that if your info is stolen, they don't cripple you
nick (8:43:08 PM):  i think that Facebook has a lot of potential to become an even bigger social networking portal - they are adding games you can play with your friends, and they are addicitive :)
amy (8:43:10 PM):  you know they arent really friends with all of them
john (8:43:15 PM):  everything has two aspect
michelle (8:43:26 PM):  nick, I agree
jordan (8:43:43 PM):  internet friends are iamginary things.
john (8:43:53 PM):  sure i like facebool
john (8:44:00 PM):  facebook
mara (8:44:01 PM):  how do you know that?  ive known a lot more than 300 people in my life and you can find people from like kindergarden on there now
michelle (8:44:05 PM):  SOmetimes I think age plays an important role here
jordan (8:44:28 PM):  you mean young peopel like it more?
mara (8:44:47 PM):  true... my younger cousin has her birthdate minus the year on her facebook and myspace page!  which is decieving
michelle (8:44:52 PM):  yong people are more addictive and make more friends from the virtual world
jordan (8:45:06 PM):  true.
jordan (8:45:26 PM):  at the cost of their eyes, necks backs , everything
john (8:45:28 PM):  yes it has good aspect for yong people
amy (8:45:40 PM):  younger people are defintely growing up in this age where it is more the NORM to share personal info
michelle (8:45:53 PM):  agree
john (8:46:00 PM):  sure
george (8:46:08 PM):  a/s/l
nick (8:46:22 PM):  yes, people have been fired for using Facebook while at home when they were supposed to be sick... i just read an article
michelle (8:46:23 PM):  george, meaning?
jordan (8:46:26 PM):  what's that? a/s/l
michelle (8:46:39 PM):  interesting...nick
mara (8:46:41 PM):  haha michelle, jordan! haha
mara (8:46:57 PM):  how do you not know this... haha thats what all the people used to say back in the day
george (8:46:58 PM):  age/sex/location...it's a cliche'd internet lingo for meeting people
amy (8:46:58 PM):  nick, good point.   why is it that they dont only allowe certain people to see their info-   the privacy settings deal
jordan (8:46:59 PM):  don't understand
michelle (8:47:00 PM):  did I miss something
mara (8:47:03 PM):  22/f/albany
michelle (8:47:25 PM):  thanks,mara and george...see, age plays
john (8:47:28 PM):  interesting
jordan (8:47:36 PM):  see.
mara (8:47:46 PM):  amy, because my mother pays for my education and i dont want her to see the pics of me partying 5 days a week haha
george (8:47:59 PM):  haha mara knows what's up
amy (8:48:03 PM):  no, i meant that guy got fired over his facebook page.....
jordan (8:48:14 PM):  do people use "gender" more than "sex" when refering to their m/f?
mara (8:48:18 PM):  shit happens
john (8:48:20 PM):  hah
amy (8:48:26 PM):  if thats true, then why didnt he have his privacy settings set so his employer knew he was playing hooky?
nick (8:48:28 PM):  yes, that woman who was fired should have kept her profile private.. although the article also mentioned that the employer may have created a fake persona who became her friend to check on her....
mara (8:48:39 PM):  no... sex is between the legs gender is int he head
amy (8:48:52 PM):  why did she add a "fake person" then?
george (8:48:57 PM):  that's a complicated question, jordan...
jordan (8:49:00 PM):  mara is a genius
mara (8:49:21 PM):  haha... im a feminist!
mara (8:49:24 PM):  what can i say...
mara (8:49:26 PM):  :D
jordan (8:49:39 PM):  all feminists are giniuses.
john (8:49:41 PM):  hehe
michelle (8:49:41 PM):  Is online ads cheaper than newspaper ads?
nick (8:49:57 PM):  Here's an article about the firing: link
george (8:50:03 PM):  yea but the internet changes what's in the head!
nick (8:50:10 PM):  "Swiss Woman Fired for Using Facebook While Sick"
mara (8:50:22 PM):  changes it?
michelle (8:50:34 PM):  I think it is illegal to fire a person that way,
jordan (8:50:43 PM):  somebody was filling out a form. when coming to "sex", he puts in twice a week. so i suppuse "gender" could be better
nick (8:50:51 PM):  Actually, the BBC article is here link
mara (8:50:53 PM):  they claim to be so michelle... my friend has like 6 websites and they dont seem to cost him too much
amy (8:51:02 PM):  nick, that article is ridiculous
george (8:51:18 PM):  she sounds like she's making an excuse for not working
john (8:51:20 PM):  yes michelle
amy (8:51:41 PM):  you can go online while sick...but to work and deal with stress at work is another thing
mara (8:51:44 PM):  really... she was prolly at home in bed bored and sick so wanted to chat with someone
george (8:52:01 PM):  just put down the iphone and sleep!
mara (8:52:02 PM):  that is not grounds for firing... she must have been a bad employee not one WE WOULD INTERVIEW haha
amy (8:52:14 PM):  and plus-  you can call in sich if you have sick days-  unless she called in sick 1x per week or something strange like that
nick (8:52:20 PM):  ha ha
amy (8:52:26 PM):  hahaha mara  we would know her type!
mara (8:52:41 PM):  totally... we rock!
george (8:52:47 PM):  it also sounds like the employer was looking for an excuse to get rid of her
jordan (8:53:03 PM):  with you
john (8:53:09 PM):  yes it is important
amy (8:53:12 PM):  i think sharing one's whole life with so many people is strange and like why does everyone need/want to know anyway
george (8:53:13 PM):  so maybe that was strike 3
mara (8:53:47 PM):  yeah i feel like that article is one example for how the media skews things
michelle (8:53:49 PM):  smart george
amy (8:53:57 PM):  media schmedia
nick (8:54:14 PM):  i agree that they were probably looking for an excuse to fire her
nick (8:54:28 PM):  why else use the fake friend to spy?
amy (8:54:45 PM):  i still dont get the fake friend bit
amy (8:54:56 PM):  how did her employer see her page
michelle (8:55:08 PM):  they may be friends
michelle (8:55:14 PM):  before he fired her
mara (8:55:19 PM):  he made a fake profile im guessing and became friends with her so it gave him access
amy (8:55:21 PM):  my supervisor asked me to friend her-  i ignored the request
jordan (8:55:23 PM):  "friend"
george (8:55:28 PM):  uh oh..."oh wait, can you delete wall posts?"  if this is one of her messages, that sounds like she was trying to cover her tracks!
nick (8:55:39 PM):  don't friend your boss!!
amy (8:55:39 PM):  but why would she accept a request from someone she doesnt know
george (8:55:41 PM):  *puts on sherlock holmes hat*
jordan (8:55:47 PM):  Need be careful when you friend aomebody
michelle (8:55:48 PM):  you made a wise decision, amy
mara (8:55:50 PM):  oh how about that cop that made a fake myspace that he was 15 yr old boy and got teenage girls to invite him over.//
jordan (8:56:15 PM):  how can i know heis my boss? what if he has a fake name?
mara (8:56:16 PM):  when he showed up as a 50 yr old cop... those girls got taught a lesson!
amy (8:56:16 PM):  woah scary stuff
michelle (8:56:33 PM):  I rejected tons of requests to my MSN,.....
amy (8:56:40 PM):  would you add someone as a friend if it was a name you did not know????
michelle (8:56:50 PM):  no
jordan (8:56:56 PM):  i usually don't
michelle (8:57:03 PM):  even I know the name, I won't...maybe it is someone else
nick (8:57:11 PM):  only if they are a friend of a friend
george (8:57:16 PM):  maybe...if the avatar was a beautiful woman
john (8:57:17 PM):  i agree with amy
michelle (8:57:36 PM):  poor george....
mara (8:57:52 PM):  i would message them and see how they knew me or something before just adding them
amy (8:58:16 PM):  well like someone said before-  its about connecting on a different level
john (8:58:16 PM):  i just add person who i familiar with
amy (8:58:29 PM):  some people are comfortable with sharing info, and others are not
george (8:58:29 PM):  but to be honest i don't use much internet stuff...no facebook, myspace, msn, aol, etc
amy (8:58:37 PM):  young people dont seem to mind sharing
john (8:58:49 PM):  sure
mara (8:58:55 PM):  nick, what if your friend that is friends with them isnt really friends with them but just added them as an unknown friend?
amy (8:58:55 PM):  what about shopping online george?
nick (8:59:04 PM):  yeah, that's a problem...
george (8:59:07 PM):  i got enough going on irl to not really desire internet friendships
jordan (8:59:10 PM):  some poeple share all their info
amy (8:59:12 PM):  hahahahha  mara
john (8:59:17 PM):  yes,
george (8:59:25 PM):  only exception is when i play an online game for an extended period of time
nick (8:59:28 PM):  george is a Casanova!
mara (8:59:39 PM):  spades?
michelle (8:59:48 PM):  jordan, how do you verify those information
george (8:59:51 PM):  sure, i sometimes buy stuff online amy, but i don't have a bunch of online friends to help me!
mara (8:59:55 PM):  so nick... you should be more mindful haha j/k
jordan (9:00:14 PM):  they have photos,
george (9:00:15 PM):  hehe nick ;0
mara (9:00:35 PM):  i ALWAYS buy stuff online
john (9:00:35 PM):  general i don't put most of my information on line
nick (9:00:36 PM):  a total stranger, i would be more careful, tho
jordan (9:00:42 PM):  of course photos can be fakes
mara (9:00:45 PM):  havent had a problem yet... knock on wood
mara (9:00:49 PM):  but my mother did once
amy (9:01:00 PM):  i worry about my info being out there sometimes
amy (9:01:10 PM):  like acct numbers, etc
mara (9:01:11 PM):  ever googled yourself?
john (9:01:12 PM):  maybe
mara (9:01:16 PM):  maybe we should all try it right now!?
jordan (9:01:18 PM):  it already is out
john (9:01:45 PM):  agree with mara
jordan (9:01:53 PM):  google, and u gets almost everything about a person.
george (9:01:55 PM):  how about twitter...people let the world know they are picking their nose or eating pudding
amy (9:01:55 PM):  it is out there- in my class we learned a little how health companies may want access to our info that is out there in regards to offering coverage
michelle (9:01:59 PM):  I worried my online shopping accounts long time ago. but now I enjoy online shopping so much so I just take it easy
mara (9:02:25 PM):  i dont get anything about me but my facebook page and you can only add me as a friend and see my pic... no info or anyhing else
nick (9:02:30 PM):  george, I can't stand Twitter
george (9:02:47 PM):  you want a good people search, i had a good one...hold on a sec
jordan (9:02:48 PM):  what's Twitter?
mara (9:02:51 PM):  "picking my nose" ahah
john (9:02:53 PM):  good mara
mara (9:03:09 PM):  yes GREAT!
george (9:03:12 PM):  link
george (9:03:23 PM):  check that search out...i think you'll be impressed
amy (9:03:35 PM):  Twitter is a service for friends, family, and co–workers to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick, frequent answers to one simple question: What are you doing?
jordan (9:03:42 PM):  what's Twitter again?
mara (9:03:43 PM):  oh wait i just found a newspaper article where my name was mentioned when my parents published an article for their 25th wedding anniversary
amy (9:03:44 PM):  that is from their website
george (9:03:51 PM):  you can find addresses and phone #s of even previous locations and sometimes a picture of the front door!
jordan (9:04:05 PM):  thanks amy
nick (9:04:51 PM):  Twitter is an online texting service - you can only send abotu 140 characters - it gets posted to a website
amy (9:04:56 PM):  wow-  zabasearch sure does delve out the info
nick (9:04:58 PM):  it's incredibly annoying
jordan (9:05:07 PM):  seems i'm still foreign er to the internet.
mara (9:05:08 PM):  OMG that website is the shit haha
mara (9:05:26 PM):  it gave me the exact location of my roommate this is freaky! how do you get that shit taken off haha
john (9:05:31 PM):  hah mara
michelle (9:05:37 PM):  I did not use twitter before
nick (9:05:50 PM):  zabasearch?
jordan (9:05:52 PM):  maybe I'll try it later on
amy (9:05:55 PM):  i wonder if people can get that stuff taken offline
john (9:06:00 PM):  it's interesting
george (9:06:14 PM):  lol you like that mara?
amy (9:06:19 PM):  like i bet their will be information policies someday bc so much personal info is out there for anyone (not just the hackers anymore)
george (9:06:34 PM):  try to find a pic of their front door
nick (9:06:38 PM):  yikes that's scary
michelle (9:07:09 PM):  do you think it is necessary to have a law or policy to protect people in internet or virtual world? and how?
nick (9:07:10 PM):  luckily they only have my old ones, not the current info!
john (9:07:15 PM):  front door
michelle (9:07:33 PM):  the screen is flashing...sometimes, noticed that?
mara (9:08:03 PM):  i love it george
amy (9:08:06 PM):  michelle, i think that is on the way...laws and policies are being developed
john (9:08:28 PM):  i think it is necessary
michelle (9:08:31 PM):  how can we know, amy?
nick (9:08:35 PM):  michelle - yes my screen flashes too - it's annoying
amy (9:08:36 PM):  its jsut that the internet is still so new and with all the new technology out there...it is easier for crimes to happen...so laws are definitely coming somehow
john (9:08:44 PM):  yes it does i noticed
jordan (9:08:47 PM):  we do have internet police, don't we?
mara (9:09:03 PM):  sorry im just searching like everyone i know right now haha
nick (9:09:05 PM):  I think it's refreshing the screen
mara (9:09:24 PM):  i think its when we are all pushing enter at the same time
amy (9:09:32 PM):  obama just came out with something having to do with copyright violation on the internet
john (9:09:37 PM):  hah  it a useful website
george (9:09:38 PM):  i think internet police are busy tracking down child porn and drug trading
amy (9:09:45 PM):  he is on the side of the industry and not the consumer
jordan (9:10:12 PM):  really amy
jordan (9:10:20 PM):  ?
george (9:10:21 PM):  imo copyrights should expire in 3 years and not be renewable
michelle (9:10:24 PM):  seen the old movie " the net" I still feel scared of the internet crime after I saw it several days ago from HBO
amy (9:10:27 PM):  so much of our info is recorded online, and people have such easy means of obtaining it....things will need to change over time
john (9:10:27 PM):  i agree
george (9:10:43 PM):  i don't believe in leaking wolverine a month before release, but after 3 years it should be open source
jordan (9:10:43 PM):  3 months is better, george
michelle (9:10:51 PM):  my eyes are really hurting....the flashing screen
amy (9:11:11 PM):  yeah jordan-  there are now real fines affiliated with downloading music illegally-  like between $100 and thousands per song
george (9:11:12 PM):  i could live with 3 months :P
jordan (9:12:19 PM):  those people make a lot money bc copyright
john (9:12:21 PM):  the screen is little bit better i think
jordan (9:12:38 PM):  you have to pay a lot just to listen to a song
amy (9:12:38 PM):  still flashing for me everyime someone writes
john (9:12:48 PM):  sure copyright is not a good thing
john (9:13:06 PM):  yes me too
nick (9:13:10 PM):  everyt time someone writes, the screen reloads completely....
george (9:13:11 PM):  i can see the flashing, too
jordan (9:13:30 PM):  flashing? i don't see
nick (9:13:41 PM):  it should be scrolling up
amy (9:13:45 PM):  well the screen goes white-  thats what i mean by flashing
john (9:13:49 PM):  just when someone writing
jordan (9:13:50 PM):  u mean the lines going up and down all the time?
michelle (9:14:09 PM):  wihte again, then flashing
mara (9:14:11 PM):  george...how did you find out about this website
jordan (9:14:18 PM):  it IS strange. nothing of this last night.
john (9:14:25 PM):  no jordan it is flashing
jordan (9:14:41 PM):  i don't see flashing.
george (9:14:41 PM):  geez...i can't remember it was a while ago
george (9:15:01 PM):  i was trying different searches trying to track down some people i lost track of
nick (9:15:17 PM):  I am going to try logging out
mara (9:15:21 PM):  no way, i dont trust you... haha i prolly wont be able to get back on then! j/k
john (9:15:42 PM):  me too
jordan (9:15:45 PM):  for me, the written lines move up and down all the time. hurts the eyes
george (9:15:56 PM):  yay flash-less screen FTW
amy (9:16:07 PM):  i logged out and came back-  its better   :)
jordan (9:16:07 PM):  no flashing
mara (9:16:14 PM):  its always done that to me.. no biggie

john (9:17:39 PM):  it is ok, right
jordan (9:17:43 PM):  strange, where r u?
michelle (9:17:51 PM):  policy for internet?
mara (9:17:52 PM):  ok so i wanted to ask you guys if you heard anything about the lastest "sexting"
mara (9:17:53 PM):  ?
amy (9:18:06 PM):  yes i did-  crazy
john (9:18:07 PM):  yes
michelle (9:18:08 PM):  ?
jordan (9:18:09 PM):  seems all suddenly vanished.
george (9:18:15 PM):  hihi
nick (9:18:18 PM):  yes
amy (9:18:37 PM):  jordan the names disappear momentrily when someone logs in
mara (9:18:38 PM):  i was asking if you guys hear about the latest news on "sexting"?
mara (9:18:50 PM):  its all over the news right now
michelle (9:19:08 PM):  i did not
michelle (9:19:23 PM):  tell me mara
george (9:19:26 PM):  i have!
nick (9:19:37 PM):  *slaps george again*
george (9:19:38 PM):  haven't had the pleasure of trying that myself tho!
jordan (9:19:41 PM):  I'll try to login again.
john (9:19:50 PM):  so many such news
mara (9:20:06 PM):  well they say that people are using text messages as a way of sexually pursuing people now
john (9:20:18 PM):  haha george
mara (9:20:19 PM):  sending videos and pics... and "booty texts" hah
michelle (9:20:20 PM):  really?
amy (9:20:26 PM):  so parents dont know what they are talking about
michelle (9:20:35 PM):  euh..
amy (9:20:52 PM):  a radio station listed a bunch of the terms online so that parents could learn the "language"
john (9:20:53 PM):  so....
nick (9:20:57 PM):  actually, it's been teens sending pictures to each other - i think charging them with crimes is ridiculous
jordan (9:21:06 PM):  i can't see
george (9:21:08 PM):  *dodges nimbly*
john (9:21:16 PM):  yes it is online language
nick (9:21:29 PM):  some teens have been charged with sending pornography - when it's pictures of themselves!
jordan (9:21:52 PM):  what r u talking about? i was out a while and you have changed the topic
mara (9:21:52 PM):  yeah its kinds of like ebonics to standard english speakers... but i like how it involves the technology its sort of like cheating by texting will soon be grounds for divorce just like internet infidelity haha
amy (9:22:08 PM):  does this play into our topic....people living different lives via the internet/ technology
michelle (9:22:25 PM):  I agree, nick, it is also hard
mara (9:22:27 PM):  jordan about "sexting" sending sex messages in text messages... pics, videos, etc
john (9:22:36 PM):  maybe teens have their own virtul world
mara (9:22:41 PM):  i think it really does... personally
amy (9:22:42 PM):  would kids take pictures of themselves and mail it to friends before technology like today
michelle (9:22:55 PM):  probably, mara
george (9:22:59 PM):  electronic booty call...good stuff
nick (9:23:04 PM):  no, but they might make drawings!
john (9:23:08 PM):  yes
mara (9:23:08 PM):  yeah its your choice i guess its not really porn...
mara (9:23:13 PM):  yeah haha george
amy (9:23:14 PM):  lol
michelle (9:23:17 PM):  don't think so, amy
jordan (9:23:21 PM):  I feel lost.
mara (9:23:27 PM):  people are really getting desperate for sex now a days
john (9:23:55 PM):  sure
amy (9:23:58 PM):  maybe its all the internet interfacing and no real relationships to feel worthy
jordan (9:24:07 PM):  oh, u r talking about sex? how.....?
mara (9:24:22 PM):  like sending a nude photo... jordan
john (9:24:22 PM):  it is the result of internet
mara (9:24:29 PM):  thats considered "sexting"
nick (9:24:38 PM):  jordan, mara has sex on her mind....
jordan (9:24:40 PM):  internet sex? sounds weird.
john (9:24:55 PM):  haha
michelle (9:25:21 PM):  jordan, like the shocking news in Hongkong last year...
mara (9:25:23 PM):  yeah you  know me nick
jordan (9:25:26 PM):  well, everybody does, sometimes.
amy (9:25:37 PM):  michelle, what?
george (9:25:50 PM):  jordan, they are talking about sending text messages with sexual content!
jordan (9:25:53 PM):  i know nothing about the HK thing.
mara (9:26:04 PM):  cyber sex used to be very common
jordan (9:26:05 PM):  I see, george.
john (9:26:11 PM):  what

nick (9:27:26 PM):  YIKES
john (9:27:41 PM):  it is serious
amy (9:27:42 PM):  what was the issue michelle-  was it photshop stuff?
michelle (9:27:50 PM):  They took those pics with only one boy whose name is Guanxi CHen, forgot the English name...Then this CHen's computer information was stolen when he sent him computer to a store for repairing.....
jordan (9:28:02 PM):  but i don't understand how can one get satisfied sexually by sending porn things through email to orther peple.
mara (9:28:08 PM):  one of my ex friends... i stress the EX.. i got her a job and she started to our boss who was eganged and sent him some nasty photos and the girls found out and ever since we dont talk anymore i think shes embarressed
john (9:28:16 PM):  haha Guanxi

jordan (9:29:01 PM):  know nothing of it.
jordan (9:29:18 PM):  you mean the movie star?
amy (9:29:21 PM):  if you dont want something shared to the world, dont put it on a computer!
michelle (9:29:25 PM):  who is crystal liu? maybe not

mara (9:41:32 PM):  right..
john (9:41:47 PM):  sure
nick (9:41:51 PM):  It's scary to think that the Chinese government is monitoring everything online in that country and replacing "objectionable" words!
jordan (9:42:04 PM):  mara says wikipedia. Is everything on wiki reliable?
mara (9:42:12 PM):  some people... young kids... dont understand the comsequences for putting info up tho so they do it ya know?
amy (9:42:31 PM):  no way-  i never use wikipedia for anything
mara (9:42:39 PM):  NOOOOOOO wikipedia is just a quick site you can check but you should just use that because i have found lots of info to be inccorrect
nick (9:42:43 PM):  even words like "earthquake" and "milk"
amy (9:42:43 PM):  why use that when you can find a reliable source for info online these days
michelle (9:42:49 PM):  wikipedia is not trustable, agree?
mara (9:42:59 PM):  i mean it is sometimes, but you should always double check
john (9:43:13 PM):  i think so
jordan (9:43:23 PM):  Well go to encarta encyclopedia.

jordan (9:45:06 PM):  what will be the topic for tomorrow?????????
mara (9:45:06 PM):  yeah george, i dont htink that everything on there is unreliable... but you hould still double check

jordan (9:47:34 PM):  see, mara.
nick (9:47:39 PM):  wait - they monitor because they care????
john (9:47:54 PM):  diffirent culture
amy (9:48:03 PM):  lack of freedom of speech

cintihia (20:05:46 PM):  alright guys has everyone read it?
eva (20:06:04 PM):  vaguely
eva (20:06:14 PM):  a little brainfried right now
cintihia (20:06:29 PM):  ight im just gonna take a minute to read the first part again
josh (20:06:29 PM):  nope
cintihia (20:07:08 PM):  ok so basically... we have to decide how to distribute our tax dollars.. but we have to use 100% of them
eva (20:07:31 PM):  they realy like to made it hard on us don't they ? ^_^'
luke (20:07:36 PM):  are there any choices given i havent quite read it yet either
cintihia (20:07:50 PM):  water and sewer
cintihia (20:07:54 PM):  highways and road
cintihia (20:08:02 PM):  refuse and recycling
cintihia (20:08:05 PM):  public library system
luke (20:08:10 PM):  kkkk
cintihia (20:08:12 PM):  senior citizens services
eva (20:08:40 PM):  haha, I know what I'm voting for!
cintihia (20:09:12 PM):  well my question is... can we do like 20-20-20-20-20
cintihia (20:09:18 PM):  is that how its going to work
eva (20:09:24 PM):  seemed that way
luke (20:09:37 PM):  lol that would be to easy i feel like
cintihia (20:09:51 PM):  ya i know
cintihia (20:10:35 PM):  i just read the water discription and it sounds like that pretty well managed
luke (20:11:10 PM):  yeaa i think it would be also more important than the other choices
eva (20:11:26 PM):  they all sound pretty well managed actually
eva (20:11:30 PM):  no one seems to be falling apart
cintihia (20:11:37 PM):  yeah exactly
eva (20:11:59 PM):  i have a personal pet one I would prioritize but i don't think i could convince anyone else
cintihia (20:12:12 PM):  i feel like highways and roads has alot of stuff in it
cintihia (20:12:15 PM):  well try us girl
moderator (20:12:49 PM):  Guys, just to clarify - the budget would also go towards Maintenance and Upkeep of already existing infrastructure.
cintihia (20:13:03 PM):  alrighty
josh (20:13:09 PM):  ok
eva (20:13:22 PM):  my personal one is the public library system, mainly because I've had to look at a public library budget before, but also because it's becoming a new community center: homeless go there, senior citizens go there, teenagers get homework help there, job hunters use computers there, events/movies are hosted there
eva (20:13:31 PM):  etc
cintihia (20:13:44 PM):  ya thats true
josh (20:13:52 PM):  good point
eva (20:13:56 PM):  of course...i also don't know the size of this city
luke (20:13:57 PM):  hmm yea
cintihia (20:14:11 PM):  i think we are just saying albany
eva (20:14:16 PM):  ah
eva (20:14:18 PM):  that helps :-)
cintihia (20:14:51 PM):  or if not lets just pretend
cintihia (20:15:15 PM):  josh and luke what are you thinking
luke (20:15:57 PM):  im thinking that the library is a good idea, but i feel like the water system would be really important for the future and maintaining certain things
cintihia (20:16:13 PM):  ya thats true
cintihia (20:16:18 PM):  josh
josh (20:16:38 PM):  like for which one shuld get the most money?
cintihia (20:16:53 PM):  yeah
cintihia (20:17:05 PM):  i think all of them should at least get 10%
josh (20:17:27 PM):  yea all of them shuld get a good amount
josh (20:17:42 PM):  but water an sewer are most important
cintihia (20:17:42 PM):  i like the senior citizens one too
eva (20:17:57 PM):  sr. citizens do need help
eva (20:18:05 PM):  services cost a lot of money for them
cintihia (20:18:23 PM):  yeah one of my grandparents used things like that all the time
cintihia (20:18:31 PM):  it really helped her out
luke (20:18:47 PM):  yeaa thats true same here
josh (20:19:02 PM):  well we can put more money towards 2 places
josh (20:19:20 PM):  we shuld rank how important they r then distribute fro there
cintihia (20:19:31 PM):  wait i thought we could give to all 5
josh (20:19:47 PM):  yea we can
cintihia (20:20:54 PM):  ight so what is everyones first choice
josh (20:21:05 PM):  water
cintihia (20:21:20 PM):  i say libraries
eva (20:21:26 PM):  libraries
cintihia (20:22:53 PM):  luke?
luke (20:23:06 PM):  sry i was i n the other room
luke (20:23:15 PM):  i say water as well
cintihia (20:23:26 PM):  ok so we are tied
eva (20:23:31 PM):  2 tied options
eva (20:23:37 PM):  i guess look at the other 3 now?
eva (20:23:42 PM):  or do we try to tie break?
luke (20:24:01 PM):  well we could always put the same percent to them as a tie and the others get less
cintihia (20:24:07 PM):  do we wanna distribute 30-20-15-10-5
cintihia (20:24:19 PM):  woops
cintihia (20:24:22 PM):  thats not right
eva (20:24:34 PM):  25-25?
cintihia (20:24:52 PM):  we could do that
luke (20:25:06 PM):  yea
cintihia (20:25:26 PM):  ok so water gets 25% and libraries get 2%
cintihia (20:25:37 PM):  hey julie
julie (20:25:44 PM):  heyy
cintihia (20:26:06 PM):  we just decided water and libraries are most important and get 25% each of the budget
julie (20:26:07 PM):  sorry my internet was down
cintihia (20:26:14 PM):  no biggie
eva (20:26:19 PM):  ooo another!

irene (20:27:06 PM):  i set my alarm before when i was napping but then i had dinner...
irene (20:27:14 PM):  anyway what were all of your opinions
cintihia (20:27:32 PM):  we just decided that water and libraries are the most important and each get 25% of the tax dollars
irene (20:27:41 PM):  what
irene (20:27:44 PM):  i thought we were talking about the world
eva (20:27:59 PM):  did you mean to go to group B?
cintihia (20:28:01 PM):  nope..
irene (20:28:09 PM):  yeah i was group a
irene (20:28:15 PM):  ohhh
irene (20:28:29 PM):  are we discussing where in the world we'd like to live?
irene (20:28:34 PM):  (in europe)
josh (20:28:35 PM):  nope
irene (20:28:37 PM):  really?
cintihia (20:28:50 PM):  yeah... that was yesterdays discussion
eva (20:28:53 PM):  ahaha
luke (20:28:55 PM):  yea
eva (20:28:55 PM):  ahhhh
cintihia (20:29:24 PM):  alright back to the topic
cintihia (20:30:03 PM):  what is the next most important thing
josh (20:30:11 PM):  senior citizens
josh (20:30:23 PM):  i say we give them 20%
cintihia (20:30:44 PM):  i agree josh
irene (20:30:47 PM):  oh i was emailed the wrong thing...
cintihia (20:31:10 PM):  care is a very important thing
cintihia (20:31:17 PM):  especially when theyre on there own
eva (20:31:20 PM):  hrmm i do consider senior citizens important...although - does anyone else wish the roads in Albany were smoother?
luke (20:31:21 PM):  treutrue
moderator (20:31:24 PM):  Hi irene - your page may not have refreshed. That was yesterday's topic.
irene (20:31:29 PM):  can someone send me the link
cintihia (20:31:42 PM):  link
irene (20:31:55 PM):  thanks
irene (20:32:02 PM):  am i group a or b?
moderator (20:32:06 PM):  Group A.
irene (20:32:13 PM):  ok
cintihia (20:32:34 PM):  i do wish that... but i think care is more important
cintihia (20:33:02 PM):  we still have 30% left
cintihia (20:33:39 PM):  if we say water 25% libraries 25% and seniors 20
irene (20:33:45 PM):  well i'd say not #5
irene (20:33:56 PM):  it says we have to distribute 100%
eva (20:34:07 PM):  to all 5 places if we choose
cintihia (20:34:38 PM):  we have already distributed 50 and r thinking about give 20% to senior services
josh (20:34:48 PM):  i think thats good
josh (20:34:57 PM):  then 15 and 15 to the others
luke (20:35:09 PM):  yaa not a bad idea
cintihia (20:35:10 PM):  yeah but were onyl half an hour thru
irene (20:35:15 PM):  ohh
luke (20:35:41 PM):  lol yeaa
irene (20:35:47 PM):  ok now i get it
luke (20:36:02 PM):  can we discuss how wed use the money in each one specificly>?
cintihia (20:36:04 PM):  i think the federal government funds the highways so maybe that shouldg et the last of our tax
irene (20:36:10 PM):  yeah
cintihia (20:36:10 PM):  sure luke great idea
cintihia (20:36:18 PM):  do u have any ideas?
irene (20:36:24 PM):  i'm not sure yet
luke (20:36:41 PM):  lol me neither
irene (20:36:54 PM):  i mean 20% for each would make it equal and no one would complain
irene (20:37:10 PM):  well they'd complain, but less
josh (20:37:21 PM):  true
josh (20:37:40 PM):  but some of the others deserve more money
cintihia (20:37:49 PM):  exactly
irene (20:38:26 PM):  yeah that's true
luke (20:38:29 PM):  yea'
cintihia (20:38:31 PM):  ok now that im thinking about it
cintihia (20:38:57 PM):  maybe we should look at recycling more... i mean we r in a global warming warning
irene (20:39:01 PM):  that's true
irene (20:39:06 PM):  but one town won't do much lol
irene (20:39:22 PM):  certain parts of the world refuse to be enivornmentally friendly unless the us pays
irene (20:39:30 PM):  at least that's what i heard somewhere
cintihia (20:39:48 PM):  ive never heard that
irene (20:39:56 PM):  i forgot where i heard it
cintihia (20:40:00 PM):  but if its true, we need to do everything we can
irene (20:40:04 PM):  yeah that's true
cintihia (20:41:06 PM):  then again... not everyone will recycle
irene (20:41:13 PM):  yeah that's true
eva (20:41:15 PM):  recycling bit is hard
irene (20:41:18 PM):  yeah
cintihia (20:41:18 PM):  if they have to put them in containers and wat not
irene (20:41:22 PM):  it's actually expensive
eva (20:41:22 PM):  i'm not even sure where to put it sometimes
irene (20:41:28 PM):  my high school didn't have recycling because it cost too much
luke (20:41:52 PM):  really?
irene (20:41:55 PM):  yea\
irene (20:42:19 PM):  and i'm from a middle-class neighborhood
cintihia (20:42:27 PM):  how did they not have recycling
irene (20:42:39 PM):  i mean the town did
irene (20:42:40 PM):  but not the school
cintihia (20:42:45 PM):  i worked at a school in downtown albany and they had recycling lol
luke (20:42:58 PM):  interestingg
luke (20:43:04 PM):  i guess its their own choice really
josh (20:43:06 PM):  yea i never heard of that
irene (20:43:16 PM):  i guess if we had more money it would help? but people still wouldn't recycle as often as they should
irene (20:43:24 PM):  we'd have to teach kids at a young age how important recycling is
eva (20:43:42 PM):  i think they try
eva (20:43:46 PM):  but there's more adults than children
cintihia (20:43:47 PM):  well thats kinda already being done
irene (20:43:49 PM):  sort of but not enough
cintihia (20:43:53 PM):  kids know alot now
irene (20:43:56 PM):  i don't know which is the most important
irene (20:44:00 PM):  or which needs the most money
cintihia (20:45:01 PM):  each is important
josh (20:45:03 PM):  water n sewer is the most important
josh (20:45:13 PM):  we can live without those working properly
cintihia (20:45:42 PM):  seniors will have a harder time tho
luke (20:46:12 PM):  yeaa true
irene (20:46:13 PM):  but how much do you need to pay for water?
josh (20:46:41 PM):  read the description
josh (20:46:51 PM):  its not just payin for water
josh (20:47:05 PM):  its the pipes and everythin else
irene (20:47:11 PM):  yeah i know
irene (20:47:17 PM):  but i feel like it wouldn't be as much
josh (20:47:44 PM):  alll of these things are actually really expensive
cintihia (20:47:52 PM):  exactly
cintihia (20:47:59 PM):  i hope we have tons of tax dollars
irene (20:48:13 PM):  yeah
irene (20:48:23 PM):  it's hard to say considreing we don't know how much each costs and what we're getting
luke (20:48:54 PM):  yeaa which we could who knows
cintihia (20:49:28 PM):  well we just gotta guess
eva (20:49:32 PM):  anybody directly affected by these things?
luke (20:49:43 PM):  hmm i dont htink i am
cintihia (20:49:57 PM):  what do u mean eva
irene (20:49:59 PM):  we probably are and just don
irene (20:50:00 PM):  t know it
cintihia (20:51:41 PM):  thats what im thinking as well
eva (20:51:42 PM):  well for example
eva (20:51:48 PM):  we are all affected by road conditions
eva (20:51:57 PM):  or how our toilets manage to not overflow
cintihia (20:52:09 PM):  haha exactly
luke (20:52:23 PM):  lol yup
irene (20:53:41 PM):  but i mean libraries are important too
irene (20:53:43 PM):  we won't die without them
irene (20:53:44 PM):  but still
cintihia (20:53:49 PM):  like eva said earlier
cintihia (20:53:55 PM):  they have alot of programs there
cintihia (20:54:02 PM):  for homeless and young children
eva (20:54:32 PM):  hehe, apparently there's violence outside too
eva (20:54:34 PM):  go figure
irene (20:54:39 PM):  of libraries?
eva (20:54:50 PM):  yeah, police have been having to break up fights
irene (20:54:59 PM):  weird
eva (20:55:01 PM):  don't why libraries have to deal with these things...
cintihia (20:55:02 PM):  thats insane
josh (20:55:06 PM):  yea
irene (20:55:18 PM):  i guess it's a clear meeting spot?
eva (20:55:18 PM):  oh well anyways
luke (20:55:18 PM):  interestingt
cintihia (20:55:26 PM):  is that around here?
irene (20:55:38 PM):  probably, albany is sketchy
eva (20:55:43 PM):  not sure about here per se, but it's sprouting around the country
cintihia (20:56:07 PM):  thats awful
cintihia (20:56:15 PM):  can u honestly not be safe anywhere
irene (20:56:25 PM):  :(
irene (20:56:32 PM):  we should put our tax dollars into police then haha
irene (20:56:40 PM):  too bad that's nto an option
cintihia (20:57:14 PM):  the police already steal our money
cintihia (20:57:35 PM):  n anyone who is a criminal justice major should be kicked out of school
josh (20:58:02 PM):  yea
cintihia (20:58:48 PM):  alright anyways.. back to the topic
luke (20:58:50 PM):  lol
eva (20:59:04 PM):  sounds like highways and water and recycling are the base services
eva (20:59:11 PM):  much as I love my libraries and senior citizens
cintihia (21:00:05 PM):  yeah
cintihia (21:00:33 PM):  well r we changing our percentages then
luke (21:01:23 PM):  what was it originally i forget
irene (21:01:26 PM):  haha
irene (21:01:31 PM):  i don't know wanything about police
irene (21:01:37 PM):  but i don't really know anything about taxes either
irene (21:01:47 PM):  i feel like this is a topic where we need a pan of professional
irene (21:01:51 PM):  *professionals
irene (21:01:52 PM):  and a town meeting
cintihia (21:02:24 PM):  it was originally libraries and water 30-30 and seniors 20
luke (21:02:39 PM):  ooo ok
josh (21:03:13 PM):  i think we shuld do a lil less for libraries
irene (21:03:27 PM):  idk i feel like libraries need the most
josh (21:04:01 PM):  they arent a top priority tho
irene (21:04:14 PM):  yeah true
cintihia (21:04:39 PM):  so what is everyones number one
luke (21:04:45 PM):  water foe me
irene (21:05:15 PM):  yeah i think we'd all agree that water is very important
eva (21:05:19 PM):  highways...my poor car T_T
irene (21:05:27 PM):  highways probably need a lot more than other things
josh (21:05:46 PM):  water
cintihia (21:05:58 PM):  but lets not forget.. highways are funded by the feds
luke (21:06:21 PM):  true
irene (21:07:35 PM):  are you sure they are
josh (21:07:36 PM):  who told you its funded by the feds
cintihia (21:07:53 PM):  ... thats why the drinking age is 21
cintihia (21:08:08 PM):  the govt told each state if they lowered the age they would take away the funding
josh (21:08:19 PM):  wut
josh (21:08:26 PM):  ur wrong
cintihia (21:08:34 PM):  y?
luke (21:08:57 PM):  i honestly have no idea anymore
cintihia (21:09:21 PM):  google it
cintihia (21:09:28 PM):  i believe they fund for at least 90% of it
luke (21:09:30 PM):  okkkkkkkkkk
josh (21:09:40 PM):  ok nvm
irene (21:09:42 PM):  i heard they'd lower the drinking age but raise the driving age
josh (21:09:53 PM):  wait
josh (21:10:20 PM):  its talking about the highway dept
josh (21:10:24 PM):  so ur wrong
josh (21:10:39 PM):  its a state run and payed thing
cintihia (21:10:41 PM):  what is..
josh (21:10:47 PM):  the highway dept
eva (21:10:57 PM):  i'm confused
luke (21:11:01 PM):  me too
eva (21:11:21 PM):  # The Town's Highway Department is responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of over 160 miles of streets and highways. In addition to its efficient snow removal and aggressive paving program, the Highway Department provides other seasonal programs such as spring cleanup, summer yard waste pickup, fall leaf pickup and snow and ice removal. Highway personnel are also responsible for the upkeep of 32 miles of sidewalks, as well as the maintenance of over 180 vehicles and equipment owned by the various Town departments.
josh (21:11:42 PM):  for all of these things the tax money is also paying for the workers salaries in each thing
josh (21:11:51 PM):  its all state tax money
cintihia (21:11:59 PM):  ok ok i see what ur saying
josh (21:12:06 PM):  so we have to take that into account
irene (21:12:06 PM):  such complications...
josh (21:12:16 PM):  heres my list
josh (21:13:12 PM):  1. water 2 hgihway 3 lib 4senior citizens 5 recycling
eva (21:13:32 PM):  hrmmm i kinda like that
josh (21:13:42 PM):  more people work for the highway dept than any one of these
josh (21:14:07 PM):  i worked for a highway dept for a summer job
cintihia (21:14:08 PM):  i like that too
irene (21:14:28 PM):  yeah i think that could work
josh (21:14:28 PM):  the amount of money that is spent for them is insane
irene (21:14:33 PM):  or we could each give 20%
luke (21:14:39 PM):  sounds good to me
cintihia (21:15:03 PM):  i think water n highway needs more money than recycling
cintihia (21:15:19 PM):  lets say water highway 25-25
irene (21:15:35 PM):  ok
josh (21:15:57 PM):  ok
cintihia (21:16:24 PM):  libraries get 20 percent?
eva (21:16:38 PM):  sounds good
cintihia (21:16:40 PM):  and seniors get 20 and recycling gets 10?
eva (21:16:44 PM):  yay!

jordan (8:21:03 PM):  sorry
meg (8:21:04 PM):  (Minus the other details)... I'm feeling better
amy (8:21:06 PM):  sorry to hear that meg
meg (8:21:09 PM):  Still kinda tired
meg (8:21:13 PM):  Its alright
meg (8:21:15 PM):  Thanks lol
amy (8:21:25 PM):  :)
meg (8:21:32 PM):  At least it wasn't swine flu
michael (8:22:11 PM):  I hear you can get anti-viral treatment for the flu if you go to the doctor first thing...
nick (8:22:46 PM):  So did everyone notice that there are new resumes today?
meg (8:22:49 PM):  Yep
michael (8:22:52 PM):  Hmm, time to start on the resume reviewing?
george (8:22:52 PM):  oh no!  what did you eat meg?
amy (8:22:56 PM):  i noticed, i noticed
nick (8:22:57 PM):  I thought we would be talking about the same ones from before...
michael (8:23:03 PM):  Yep, took a look.
amy (8:23:19 PM):  oh gosh- that would be boring to talk about the old ones
meg (8:23:21 PM):  I had some burritos (frozen ones) my room mate got
meg (8:23:27 PM):  But they were bad
nick (8:23:30 PM):  yes, i'm glad!
jordan (8:23:35 PM):  not the same position.
michael (8:23:39 PM):  That would be rough, felt like we covered those in detail.
amy (8:23:47 PM):  lol  this position is a little more interesting i found
jordan (8:23:48 PM):  different people.
meg (8:23:58 PM):  Yeah it looks good
george (8:24:12 PM):  :(
michael (8:24:17 PM):  The degrees seem more applicable in general.
amy (8:24:23 PM):  shall we go through one at a time or does someone have another suggestion
amy (8:24:27 PM):  ?
michael (8:24:29 PM):  I won't have to whine all night about people leaving as soon as they graduate.
john (8:24:30 PM):  why amy?
jordan (8:24:31 PM):  don't u think girls are better for this position? more considerate and careful.
nick (8:24:32 PM):  yes, better all around
michael (8:24:42 PM):  Sounds fine to me.
meg (8:24:45 PM):  I think that was a good way
george (8:24:45 PM):  grocery shopping, errands around house, companionship
amy (8:24:52 PM):  why what
nick (8:25:03 PM):  yes amy
amy (8:25:05 PM):  ok  so meg smith
michelle (8:25:17 PM):  I think girls are better
amy (8:25:43 PM):  hi michelle-  didt see ya there til now
michael (8:25:47 PM):  A Lit degree in progress must mean she likes reading at least.
nick (8:25:49 PM):  I have a question: the required age is 18, but are interviewers allowed to ask a candidate's age?
john (8:26:05 PM):  girls are better?
meg (8:26:15 PM):  Yeah they are allowed
jordan (8:26:19 PM):  don't u think so?
amy (8:26:20 PM):  good question- didnt think of that-  maybe they just base it one what year they are in college
meg (8:26:20 PM):  It's in the app
michelle (8:26:38 PM):  Hi amy, sorry I am late
michael (8:26:49 PM):  18 requirement is usually for legal purposes, isn't it? That isn't exactly age discrimination...
jordan (8:26:51 PM):  age doesn't make a different for this job i guess.
amy (8:27:00 PM):  she has a little volunteer experience going for her-  that was her only plus that i saw
john (8:27:03 PM):  sure nick it is not
nick (8:27:08 PM):  I thought asking age was against the law?
michael (8:27:15 PM):  All the resumes list some sort of college work, I assume everyone meets the age requirement anyway.
nick (8:27:23 PM):  OK
amy (8:27:30 PM):  yeah- i think their ages are fine
jordan (8:27:33 PM):  is it, nick?
michelle (8:27:34 PM):  nick, I agree
meg (8:28:01 PM):  I didn't think it was, you'd find out with the soc sec # either way
john (8:28:05 PM):  yes i think they can get the candidate's age by other way
michael (8:28:12 PM):  The McDonalds experience might teach you to be polite at least.
jordan (8:28:31 PM):  is age that important for this positin?
michelle (8:28:47 PM):  These candidates look fine, which one do we pick?
amy (8:28:47 PM):  i would definitely keep her on the list- wouldnt rule her out bc she does have good experience in working
nick (8:29:05 PM):  The job desciprtion says they msut be 18 - some college freshman are not
amy (8:29:12 PM):  we're going through the resumes one at a time, michelle   just to talk about them all
john (8:29:15 PM):  it is a good experence
michelle (8:29:18 PM):  amy, who is your pick?
michael (8:29:30 PM):  Ah, didn't realize freshmen could be that young.
meg (8:29:31 PM):  She's got good experience for the development center
michelle (8:29:33 PM):  where are we now
jordan (8:29:39 PM):  some are.
amy (8:29:47 PM):  didnt decide yet, michelle
jordan (8:29:48 PM):  age
michael (8:29:54 PM):  I like the volunteering...shows community involvement.
amy (8:30:02 PM):  first resume-  megan
john (8:30:02 PM):  so college freshman are not candidates?
michelle (8:30:07 PM):  thanks
nick (8:30:11 PM):  Megan's best qualifications are her volunteer experience
amy (8:30:14 PM):  frosh can be 18
george (8:30:19 PM):  what is MESA club?
amy (8:30:36 PM):  i agree nick-  that is what keeps her on deck in my mind opposed to saying No right away
meg (8:30:43 PM):  I'm not sure about MESA
michelle (8:30:52 PM):  I agree too
amy (8:31:01 PM):  mesa?  no clue
jordan (8:31:04 PM):  you mean Megan?
john (8:31:10 PM):  i think volunteer experience is important
nick (8:31:31 PM):  She is not my favorite, though
amy (8:31:44 PM):  ok  alex matthews is next
meg (8:31:51 PM):  Me neither, shall we me on
jordan (8:31:55 PM):  i choose between the girls
amy (8:31:55 PM):  unless anyone has something to add....
meg (8:31:55 PM):  move:-P
michael (8:32:14 PM):  Biology seems like the least applicable degree among the applicants.
michelle (8:32:15 PM):  o.k. matthews
meg (8:32:21 PM):  Men might be good for the job though
jordan (8:32:25 PM):  :-)
john (8:32:34 PM):  i perfer to girls
jordan (8:32:40 PM):  men are not careful enough
meg (8:32:41 PM):  Good GPA
amy (8:32:45 PM):  matthew is alright with some responsibiltiy and tutoring
michelle (8:32:55 PM):  which personality is more important in this job?
george (8:32:56 PM):  elizabeth/megan
michelle (8:33:12 PM):  patient, experience or leadership?
jordan (8:33:20 PM):  certainly a sense of responsibiity michelle
nick (8:33:20 PM):  jordan, you are making some sexist assumptions!!!!
john (8:33:33 PM):  patient
jordan (8:33:33 PM):  ah, am I?
amy (8:33:34 PM):  he seems more like a leader-  not sure if he would relate real well one on one for too long
john (8:33:48 PM):  haha nick
meg (8:33:48 PM):  he has better volunteer things
meg (8:33:57 PM):  There are a lot of male nurses
meg (8:34:03 PM):  I agree with nick a little...
nick (8:34:05 PM):  yes, you are - please provide evidence :)
meg (8:34:19 PM):  Men are just as proficient as women in regards to health care
nick (8:34:31 PM):  Thank you meg
jordan (8:34:40 PM):  sometimes assumptions are made based on life experiences.
amy (8:34:41 PM):  i totally missed this- men vs women for elder assistance??  whats the difference
meg (8:34:42 PM):  No problem
michelle (8:35:10 PM):  men might be good in taking care of handicapped people
meg (8:35:12 PM):  Yeah but that's the same thing with stereotypes
george (8:35:12 PM):  patience, imo!
jordan (8:35:13 PM):  as i said, amy, men are not carful enough
john (8:35:38 PM):  i prefer to girls for this
michelle (8:35:44 PM):  jordan, we need statistical results to verify
nick (8:35:58 PM):  Wow, I hope I never have to be hired by you, jordan!
michael (8:35:58 PM):  That's kind of sexist, isn't it? There are careful men and careless women out there....
michelle (8:36:00 PM):  though I like girls for this position personally
jordan (8:36:00 PM):  patience, yes. don't u think women are more patient than men?
amy (8:36:02 PM):  but there are so many good sons out there taking care of their ailing mothers-
michelle (8:36:13 PM):  agree, michael
john (8:36:14 PM):  though some of the men are patience,too
michael (8:36:20 PM):  Why not look at the person themself and not their gender.
jordan (8:36:26 PM):  me too.
michelle (8:36:28 PM):  agree, amy
meg (8:36:30 PM):  Agreed
michelle (8:36:36 PM):  yeah, michael
amy (8:36:38 PM):  what if its a male elderly person-  he might prefer a guy to play checkers with or something.....
michelle (8:36:45 PM):  let's go back to matthews
amy (8:36:48 PM):  totally michael!
meg (8:36:49 PM):  I like michael's idea
jordan (8:36:50 PM):  I don't have prejudice against men, being a man myself.
john (8:36:56 PM):  agree michael
amy (8:37:07 PM):  gender does not play a role in choosing an employee because that is wrong!
amy (8:37:17 PM):  (said with the softest of tones, but sternly)   lol
meg (8:37:19 PM):  He's spanish proficient
meg (8:37:22 PM):  it might be good
jordan (8:37:31 PM):  sorry
meg (8:37:39 PM):  (also against the law)
john (8:37:51 PM):  is it?
george (8:37:55 PM):  men are hairy and sweaty too; would you want a hairy sweaty man touching your grandma???
nick (8:38:24 PM):  I actually don't think Matthews is qualified... nothign to do with his gender
amy (8:38:27 PM):  we do not discriminate against race, gender, sexuality, religion, etc.....  the disclaimer along the bottom of job desctriptions
jordan (8:38:31 PM):  waaaaa, george is right.
michelle (8:38:32 PM):  oh, george
michael (8:38:38 PM):  Hmm, the tutoring does involve reading at least, which is mentioned in the job description.
michelle (8:38:43 PM):  I second nick
meg (8:38:44 PM):  hahaha george
michelle (8:38:49 PM):  nothing to do with gender
amy (8:38:55 PM):  hopefully the can ALL read   hahahahha
john (8:39:13 PM):  agree george
michelle (8:39:15 PM):  i do see matthew's leaership potential
amy (8:39:15 PM):  next up.........
george (8:39:18 PM):  so, if two resumes were exactly the same, you'd pick a female over a male?
michael (8:39:22 PM):  His experience is no where near some of the others who have actually done homebound meals or transported poeple, though.
meg (8:39:36 PM):  Thanks amy
meg (8:39:38 PM):  No
michelle (8:39:41 PM):  george, we will interview then
john (8:39:46 PM):  i think so george
jordan (8:39:52 PM):  well let's put age and gender aside.
meg (8:39:53 PM):  That's ridiculous
amy (8:40:07 PM):  Natalie seems to be a nice gal
amy (8:40:10 PM):  ;)
michael (8:40:12 PM):  You could call up their references too, if the resumes were equal.
nick (8:40:14 PM):  I like Natalie's experience with Home Bound Meals
jordan (8:40:29 PM):  a sense of duty and patience do matter.
john (8:40:33 PM):  gender is important in this position
george (8:40:39 PM):  do the seniors have a gender preference tho?  their opinions might matter more than ours :o
michael (8:40:46 PM):  Human Services degree is fitting for this job.
meg (8:40:51 PM):  Gender does not matter for ANY position
michelle (8:41:16 PM):  Natalie seems promising.,,,
amy (8:41:17 PM):  but w/ the homebound, did she get out and be with the people....looks like she was just with the volunteers training them- not necessatily outside the office
meg (8:41:20 PM):  It's against the law!
jordan (8:41:23 PM):  yes
george (8:41:33 PM):  *waves*
meg (8:41:40 PM):  Red cross too
michael (8:41:46 PM):  Red Cross shows some community involvement.
michelle (8:41:47 PM):  no gender discussions, please
amy (8:41:47 PM):  george- that is valid, but i'm sure the interviewees must be aware of preference of their clients
michelle (8:42:11 PM):  the red cross experience is impressive
amy (8:42:20 PM):  i like how she worked with kids
meg (8:42:25 PM):  She's got good things for the meal thing- I afree
jordan (8:42:26 PM):  lets see who is the most responsible.
amy (8:42:28 PM):  hands-on, leadership
meg (8:42:34 PM):  Her BS is in human services
michelle (8:42:40 PM):  keep natalie on the final list?
amy (8:42:44 PM):  definite plus mef
amy (8:42:47 PM):  meg
meg (8:42:47 PM):  Yes
john (8:42:56 PM):  agree jordan
michelle (8:43:01 PM):  jordan, it is hard to tell responsibility from resumes
amy (8:43:06 PM):  shows commitment to the field
meg (8:43:09 PM):  lol
george (8:43:13 PM):  wow i'm lagging bad...i'll relog
meg (8:43:26 PM):  Who's next?
john (8:43:37 PM):  human services is good for the position
amy (8:43:40 PM):  i think she is a good candidate
amy (8:43:48 PM):  maybe not the best though
amy (8:43:52 PM):  we'll see
michelle (8:44:14 PM):  brian?
john (8:44:24 PM):  agree
michael (8:44:26 PM):  If an applicant kept a hard job going a long time that's an indication toward responsibility at least...
michelle (8:44:28 PM):  nursing bachelor!!!!
jordan (8:44:45 PM):  she is.
meg (8:45:00 PM):  Nursing!
meg (8:45:04 PM):  He's a nurse!
nick (8:45:05 PM):  Aren't we talking about Jeremy?
michelle (8:45:08 PM):  michael, excellent point...but maybe he or she doesn't want to change?
michael (8:45:16 PM):  We skipped Jeremy?
meg (8:45:18 PM):  Brian
amy (8:45:24 PM):  jeremy is up now
meg (8:45:25 PM):  Woops
george (8:45:44 PM):  ooh jeremy madison = german speaker
amy (8:45:44 PM):  oh   ooops  i was on jeremys resume
michelle (8:45:50 PM):  sorry, jeremy?
meg (8:46:03 PM):  Sociology
jordan (8:46:04 PM):  i don't think jeremy can be good for it
amy (8:46:06 PM):  yup jeremy
meg (8:46:09 PM):  That's good for human interaction
nick (8:46:12 PM):  Jeremy's welfare experience sounds great
meg (8:46:31 PM):  He also paid his way which means he knows how to budget for groceries
amy (8:46:34 PM):  oh i like him best!
michelle (8:46:37 PM):  jeremy is not that impressive, nothing to do with gender!
jordan (8:46:40 PM):  you don't have to have GREAT education to do this work
michael (8:46:44 PM):  I like the welfare experience, he even did transportation which is in the job description.
amy (8:46:45 PM):  good work background
george (8:46:53 PM):  sounds like jeremy has a lot of people experience
nick (8:46:58 PM):  He's tutores, so he can interact adn converse
michael (8:47:08 PM):  The dealing with parents and families would include some people of the job's age group too, at least.
michelle (8:47:13 PM):  yes, a lot of people skills
amy (8:47:29 PM):  Provide transportation for clients to and from court mandated , Greeted customers, escorted them to seats, and took food and drink orders,  Run support groups for family and help them cope with job-related pressures
jordan (8:47:37 PM):  maybe the senior people don't want too much talking to
meg (8:47:48 PM):  I think he beats out Natalie
amy (8:47:53 PM):  lol  maybe not michael
amy (8:48:01 PM):  i think he would be conscientious though (sp?)
nick (8:48:09 PM):  The job description says "Companionship to the senior. Carry on conversations, assist in reading and maintain a friendly atmosphere."
george (8:48:13 PM):  yea jeremy fits the job description to a t
michelle (8:48:15 PM):  meg, let's also put him on the final list
amy (8:48:18 PM):  oops  i meant to note jordan's comment
michael (8:48:21 PM):  I like his more general objective, makes me feel like he'll see the job as part of a career/profession rather than just money.
jordan (8:48:47 PM):  yes
amy (8:48:49 PM):  yeah werent you the one who didnt like how people put their objective to match the job?? michael
george (8:48:54 PM):  if they don't want jeremy to talk to them, he can just mumble under his breath in german and they won't know what he's saying!
nick (8:49:04 PM):  LOL
amy (8:49:05 PM):  hahaha
john (8:49:21 PM):  haha
nick (8:49:33 PM):  I will avoid making ethnic jokes about Germans.... :)
amy (8:49:47 PM):  sprechen sie deutsch?
amy (8:50:05 PM):  ok  last up.....
michael (8:50:10 PM):  Hmm, someone else made that point with the girl wanting to work with different a different age group then the job description that session. I admit I agreed with it, though. ^^
jordan (8:50:10 PM):  Parlez vouz francais?
amy (8:50:14 PM):  your pal Brian
michael (8:50:20 PM):  than* even
amy (8:50:30 PM):  nein, nur deutsch
meg (8:50:38 PM):  Brian's a nurse
michelle (8:50:53 PM):  I like Brian's resume.
jordan (8:50:54 PM):  ich habe hunge
meg (8:50:54 PM):  Nursing degree and member of the ANA- american nurses association
nick (8:50:58 PM):  Why does Brian have question marks all over his resume???????
michelle (8:51:08 PM):  what is that? german
amy (8:51:14 PM):  hmmm too clinical though instead of someone who the person can enjoy being around????
meg (8:51:23 PM):  I think it was a problem with formatting
meg (8:51:25 PM):  the file
john (8:51:28 PM):  nurse is helpful
amy (8:51:29 PM):  i think the bullets were off nick   ya think?
michelle (8:51:47 PM):  nick, not a big deal
michael (8:51:50 PM):  Brian seems a little lacking in community involvement. The others have things like the Red Cross, Red Coat, Wellness and Tutoring...
michelle (8:51:53 PM):  i mean the marks
meg (8:51:54 PM):  Also dealt with wellness clinic
nick (8:51:54 PM):  yes, probably
amy (8:52:02 PM):  agree
meg (8:52:05 PM):  He did the wellness clinic though
meg (8:52:17 PM):  Good awards
nick (8:52:20 PM):  but it's annoying to grumpy HR reps liek me
george (8:52:20 PM):  you can get a bachelors in nursing?  i thought that was just an RN
michael (8:52:22 PM):  The job description did mention the seniors should remain a part of their community, not just in their home.
michelle (8:52:31 PM):  brian seems more professional here
john (8:52:34 PM):  sure michael
amy (8:52:41 PM):  But where in the resume has he built on his people skills?????
nick (8:52:52 PM):  Note that the job description says "Senior Assistants are not required to possess any medical training/background."
jordan (8:52:54 PM):  true
michelle (8:53:00 PM):  good question, amy
nick (8:53:11 PM):  agree, amy
michael (8:53:19 PM):  I guess he did deal with patients a bit at the clinic.
michelle (8:53:30 PM):  but it helps, nick. making people feel safer
meg (8:53:31 PM):  Have to have people skills with being a waitor
amy (8:53:34 PM):  i thnk he is too focused on the nursing-  maybe he wants to become a doctor eventually...and we know they tend not to be "people-focused"
jordan (8:53:35 PM):  have we had our decision made?
michelle (8:53:38 PM):  if there is a nurse around
michael (8:53:39 PM):  Sounds like check in, check out, appointment calls.
nick (8:53:46 PM):  miclelle - at Applebee's?
michelle (8:53:55 PM):  doctor also needs people skills
john (8:53:57 PM):  is it helpful? michael
amy (8:54:30 PM):  i think people working in social services have much more people skills than medically based professions
michael (8:54:43 PM):  Hmm, Jeremy was a waiter too.
meg (8:54:53 PM):  But you can't be a waitor with bad people skills
amy (8:54:55 PM):  but i dont think brians resume meets the job description well overall
meg (8:54:57 PM):  *waiter
john (8:55:01 PM):  agree to amy
nick (8:55:11 PM):  you can be a bad waiter
amy (8:55:24 PM):  at a chain?  people workign there can def have great people skills
george (8:55:28 PM):  i like jeremy and natalie
nick (8:55:41 PM):  i vote for jeremy
meg (8:55:43 PM):  And keep your job for a year and 1/2?
jordan (8:55:44 PM):  to be a waiter is still different from being a nurse
michelle (8:55:45 PM):  brian and jeremy
amy (8:55:46 PM):  but i dont think its a dream job-  maybe for some though
meg (8:55:48 PM):  I like Jeremy and Brian
jordan (8:56:01 PM):  natalie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
meg (8:56:02 PM):  Yes but there's still basic people skills you learn

meg (8:56:56 PM):  lol
jordan (8:57:09 PM):  Susie for a differnt job

amy (9:36:34 PM):  it flashes when peeople log out or log in i believe
jordan (9:36:37 PM):  Oh, I see. I'm forgetful.
michael (9:37:02 PM):  1984, that's where the term Orwellian comes from, isn't it?
meg (9:37:04 PM):  So virtual reality
jordan (9:37:04 PM):  1984 by George Orwell is about totalitarianism
george (9:37:05 PM):  :o
amy (9:37:08 PM):  ohhhhh i forgot too
meg (9:37:13 PM):  Yeah probably
amy (9:37:21 PM):  what is the storyline?
george (9:37:38 PM):  hihi
meg (9:37:44 PM):  I haven't read it

meg (9:38:24 PM):  by Aldous Huxley
john (9:38:24 PM):  ok
michelle (9:38:25 PM):  me either
amy (9:38:27 PM):  like bc there are so many people, names are not important anymore??
nick (9:39:09 PM):  They are both great books!
jordan (9:39:11 PM):  people living in a totalitarian world, forfeiting everything individual,,,, you know
nick (9:39:25 PM):  Classics
jordan (9:39:27 PM):  there are cameras even in your vbedroom
amy (9:39:32 PM):  oh
meg (9:39:38 PM):  1984 is on my reading list for the summer
jordan (9:39:50 PM):  yes, right. Brave New world is similar.
amy (9:39:54 PM):  maybe i'll add it to my list also
michael (9:40:05 PM):  There was a bad scenario in one of my user interface textbooks this semester titled "Panopticon"...a term that apparently means everything you do can be seen.
nick (9:40:18 PM):  They are depressing though :)
george (9:40:22 PM):  looks like about 2 min 30 sec lag
meg (9:40:24 PM):  Yeah, it comes from Jeremy Betham
meg (9:40:27 PM):  *Bentham
amy (9:40:33 PM):  what is depressing?
jordan (9:40:36 PM):  bpanopticon. the exact word
john (9:40:56 PM):  hehe good idea amy
meg (9:40:59 PM):  He's a philosopher
nick (9:41:09 PM):  amy - 1984 and Brave New World are both dark books, just FYI
meg (9:41:11 PM):  Foucault used it for Discipline and Punishment
meg (9:41:21 PM):  But excellent
jordan (9:41:23 PM):  what is depressing is thaT PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR INDIVIDUALITY , THEIR PERSONALITY, EVERTHING , JUST FOR THE SAKE STABILITY
meg (9:41:25 PM):  I love the ending of BNW
amy (9:41:28 PM):  well, i enjoy dark movies (not violent, but dark)
amy (9:41:35 PM):  so maybe these will be interesting
jordan (9:41:37 PM):  sorry for capitalizing
michael (9:41:41 PM):  You do lose a lot of control over who sees the things you post online.
jordan (9:42:02 PM):  1984 has been adapted to movies two times.
john (9:42:06 PM):  dark book?
nick (9:42:08 PM):  meg - I loved Discipline and Punishment  and the Panopticon stuff!
jordan (9:42:11 PM):  I prwefer the first.
amy (9:42:12 PM):  did the movies adapt well?
meg (9:42:16 PM):  In BNW there's a separation between european populations and native american populations
michael (9:42:19 PM):  There was a 1984 related Apple commercial too, wasn't there?
amy (9:42:20 PM):  i would rather read them i think
meg (9:42:27 PM):  I love Foucault
meg (9:42:30 PM):  lol
jordan (9:42:42 PM):  the first is good, the second seems a bit exagerated.
meg (9:43:03 PM):  I read archaeology of knowledge too for one of my classes
george (9:43:03 PM):  "you've got to be joking, mr feynman" is a great book
jordan (9:43:06 PM):  people who can understand foucould must be a genius
meg (9:43:08 PM):  It's HARD
george (9:43:14 PM):  er...surely you're joking
meg (9:43:20 PM):  lol
nick (9:43:32 PM):  Foucault was into SandM, which explains a lot about him :)

amy (9:44:53 PM):  oh, title
jordan (9:44:59 PM):  author of HandS???

amy (9:45:06 PM):  author  charlotte perkins gilman
meg (9:45:13 PM):  Foucault wrote Discipline and Punishment, Archaeology of knowledge and History of knowledge...
jordan (9:45:14 PM):  we still have a lot to taLK ABOUT.

caroline (19:58:53 PM):  hii
moderator (19:59:43 PM):  Hi all, this is moderator.
meg (19:59:53 PM):  Hi moderator
ted (19:59:58 PM):  hello all
lynn (19:59:58 PM):  hi moderator
melany (20:00:03 PM):  Hi moderator
moderator (20:00:10 PM):  Carla is supposed to lead today and we are also waiting for one more person, Vincent.
moderator (20:00:30 PM):  I request you to wait a few moments.
meg (20:00:45 PM):  Ok
melany (20:01:09 PM):  Ok
moderator (20:05:22 PM):  Hi all, I suppose you may begin now.
meg (20:05:30 PM):  Ok
moderator (20:05:30 PM):  Please make sure you reach a consensus at the end. :-)
melany (20:05:43 PM):  what is the topic? my link does not work.
lynn (20:05:50 PM):  it's about hallmark holidays
meg (20:05:57 PM):  It's whether or not hallmark holidays are good
melany (20:06:02 PM):  ok
moderator (20:06:04 PM):  link
melany (20:06:06 PM):  thanks!
meg (20:06:42 PM):  I really hate Valentine's day
meg (20:06:53 PM):  hahaha, my boyfriend really loves it though
melany (20:07:08 PM):  haha, i'm indifferent towards vday
melany (20:07:16 PM):  i find it to be very commercial
lynn (20:07:23 PM):  it is very commercial
melany (20:07:23 PM):  but i dont mind getting candy
caroline (20:07:26 PM):  i feel like that's unusual for the guy to be more into it than the girl haha
meg (20:07:28 PM):  I think its a little waste of time
melany (20:07:37 PM):  yeah and money
meg (20:07:40 PM):  Yeah, he loves the whole romantic thing
melany (20:07:49 PM):  we only celebrate it because hallmark tells us too
ted (20:07:49 PM):  i like them all. although i never heard about some of them. like christmas in july or boss' day
meg (20:08:01 PM):  I know boss's day
melany (20:08:02 PM):  yeah what is sweetest day?
caroline (20:08:11 PM):  i think it is very commercial as well but i think the concept in a less cliche, less commercialized way is appealing
lynn (20:08:11 PM):  i don't necessarily agree that we only celebrate v-day because hallmark tells us too
caroline (20:08:20 PM):  i have no idea what sweetest day is
caroline (20:08:32 PM):  i agree with lynn
meg (20:08:32 PM):  This is the defn for sweetest day: Sweetest Day is an observance celebrated primarily in the Great Lakes region and parts of the Northeast United States on the third Saturday in October. It is described by Retail Confectioners International as an "occasion which offers all of us an opportunity to remember not only the sick, aged and orphaned, but also friends, relatives and associates whose helpfulness and kindness we have enjoyed."Sweetest Day has also been referred to as a "concocted promotion" created by the candy industry solely to increase sales of candy.
lynn (20:08:36 PM):  i'd never heard of sweetest day either
meg (20:08:53 PM):  It sounds dumb
melany (20:08:56 PM):  that sounds bizarre to me
caroline (20:09:09 PM):  that is so weird
melany (20:09:16 PM):  how do you celebrate? buying candy?
lynn (20:09:19 PM):  the candy industry must be important up there
meg (20:09:21 PM):  I guess
melany (20:09:25 PM):  weird
ted (20:09:32 PM):  i celebrate octoberfest instead of sweetest day. it is very commercial, and hallmark has nothing to do with it
meg (20:09:43 PM):  Boss's day was really lame because we used to do it at my old job and no one particularly liked our boss
meg (20:09:52 PM):  I like oktoberfest!
melany (20:09:55 PM):  haha, what are you supposed to do for boss's day?
caroline (20:09:55 PM):  i think bosses get enough
caroline (20:09:58 PM):  they don't need a holiday
lynn (20:10:04 PM):  hehe
caroline (20:10:10 PM):  i'm not going to celebrate someone who has more power and money than me--get out of here
meg (20:10:12 PM):  Give them a bottle of wine or a card
meg (20:10:15 PM):  I know!
melany (20:10:21 PM):  that's so dumb
melany (20:10:34 PM):  they should have an employee's day then
meg (20:10:35 PM):  My dad does Boss's day, but he's the boss lol so he gets the enjoyment of it
meg (20:10:40 PM):  They do sometimes
melany (20:10:45 PM):  haha yeah that's nice for him
caroline (20:10:46 PM):  what does he get out of it?
meg (20:11:13 PM):  He has two secretaries in his dept and they'll give him candy or a bottle of wine
lynn (20:11:25 PM):  does he reciprocate for secretaries day?
meg (20:11:26 PM):  But he pays them back on admin. assistants day
meg (20:11:28 PM):  Yes
meg (20:11:42 PM):  He treats them well because he knows he couldn't do his job without them!
melany (20:11:53 PM):  yeah that's good he reciprocates
melany (20:12:07 PM):  what does everyone think about mothers and fathers day?
meg (20:12:15 PM):  I think that they're good
lynn (20:12:18 PM):  i like them
caroline (20:12:26 PM):  i think they're good too
alyssa (20:12:30 PM):  hello
melany (20:12:31 PM):  yeah i think there is meaning to them
meg (20:12:34 PM):  hi alyssa
melany (20:12:37 PM):  hi alyssa
ted (20:12:45 PM):  all these holidays try to make us remember about someone who is sometimes overlooked
lynn (20:12:46 PM):  my mom and dad's generation don't like mother's/father's day
melany (20:12:57 PM):  oh really? why's that?
lynn (20:12:57 PM):  at least that's what they tell me
caroline (20:13:01 PM):  i think cards are perfect for fathers/mothers day--because presents are a little extreme in my opinion
meg (20:13:01 PM):  really? I always thought it was nice
meg (20:13:15 PM):  I get my mom flowers every year
meg (20:13:23 PM):  And I give my dad a card lol
melany (20:13:33 PM):  my parents always expect something, i usually get them gift cards or something and a card
alyssa (20:13:33 PM):  well would you guys consider valentines day a hallmark holiday
caroline (20:13:35 PM):  that's good too--i just don't think it's a time of year to get someone like an ipod
lynn (20:13:41 PM):  i think they find it kind of silly, although they really apprecaite us getting them cards, flowers, etc. I think they like the thought that we are thinking of them more than anything
meg (20:13:58 PM):  Yeah, I agree with that
meg (20:14:06 PM):  My mom's just happy if I give her a call
melany (20:14:09 PM):  yeah, i'd feel really bad if i forgot to recognize it
lynn (20:14:20 PM):  alyssa, ,to answer your question, no i don't
caroline (20:14:28 PM):  i do an i don't
alyssa (20:14:28 PM):  i think valentines day is blown way over the top
alyssa (20:14:32 PM):  with the cards
meg (20:14:33 PM):  I do think it is
meg (20:14:36 PM):  I hate it
alyssa (20:14:38 PM):  and the flowers and the chocolates
lynn (20:14:39 PM):  it is blown way over the top, but it would exist without hallmark
melany (20:14:46 PM):  yeah i enjoy it but i think it is over the top
alyssa (20:14:49 PM):  yup
caroline (20:14:54 PM):  yea i think hallmark blows it over the top but i think it would exist w/o the commercialization
melany (20:14:56 PM):  even when im single i like it because my dad gets me a valentine
ted (20:14:58 PM):  the idea behind valentines is nice
melany (20:14:58 PM):  haha
caroline (20:15:04 PM):  aw my dad too
lynn (20:15:04 PM):  aw....
ted (20:15:15 PM):  business try to make as much profit as they can
meg (20:15:17 PM):  V-day started because of a guy who was a martyr
alyssa (20:15:17 PM):  yeah i just dont think people should wait till valentines day to tell someone they love them
meg (20:15:24 PM):  I agree
lynn (20:15:25 PM):  if you live far away, cards are ideal
alyssa (20:15:25 PM):  really
melany (20:15:26 PM):  i agree
lynn (20:15:27 PM):  i agree
meg (20:15:29 PM):  Yeah
alyssa (20:15:33 PM):  i didnt know know about the martyr thing
meg (20:15:37 PM):  link
melany (20:15:38 PM):  me either
lynn (20:15:49 PM):  that's why i think it's not a hallmark holiday
caroline (20:16:00 PM):  i don't think you should wait til then either but i think it's nice to designate a day to make sure you do something nice with someone etc.
melany (20:16:17 PM):  yeah it definetly is rooted in more meaning than just hallmark, but i think hallmark amplifies it
meg (20:16:22 PM):  I'd rather do something nice once in a while than wait for one day of the year to be all lovey-dovey
meg (20:16:24 PM):  haha
alyssa (20:16:34 PM):  yeah but they have to
alyssa (20:16:39 PM):  otherwise they wont make as much money
meg (20:16:48 PM):  Oh yeah
melany (20:16:53 PM):  yeah, all money-making
ted (20:17:03 PM):  roses are more expensive in valentines than in any other day
lynn (20:17:10 PM):  it is a business that employs people after all. i'm from kansas city, and hallmark is a big part of that city's economy
alyssa (20:17:20 PM):  what is christmas in july
alyssa (20:17:24 PM):  ive never even heard of that
lynn (20:17:28 PM):  me either
caroline (20:17:44 PM):  i've heard the phrase but i didn't know that that was a real "holiday"
meg (20:17:47 PM):  One of the links that she put up there explains it
melany (20:17:55 PM):  i dont know much about it besides going to bars in july and them having christmas themed parties called "christmas in july"
meg (20:18:13 PM):  Yeah, its kind of a dumb holiday
caroline (20:18:28 PM):  i think that sounds really fun lol
caroline (20:18:31 PM):  but not worthy of cards
meg (20:18:34 PM):  But in the southern hemisphere they have it because of the northern hemispheres association between christmas and snow
caroline (20:18:36 PM):  why would you get someone a card for that
caroline (20:18:44 PM):  interesting
melany (20:18:56 PM):  oh yeah it's fun
melany (20:19:03 PM):  but i don't think you would send someone a card
alyssa (20:19:08 PM):  but yeah i think fathers and mothers day
alyssa (20:19:14 PM):  are definitely worth noting
caroline (20:19:19 PM):  absolutely
lynn (20:19:21 PM):  me too
ted (20:19:21 PM):  snows in chile and argentina in july. good point meg
alyssa (20:19:25 PM):  because they actually have a purpose
melany (20:19:38 PM):  yeah very true
meg (20:20:02 PM):  Yeah, mothers and fathers day is nice
meg (20:20:11 PM):  I mean, I want lots of presents when I'm a mom lol
alyssa (20:20:12 PM):  but sweetest day sounds just stupid
meg (20:20:17 PM):  I agree
alyssa (20:20:20 PM):  link
caroline (20:20:21 PM):  haha yea
alyssa (20:20:26 PM):  truly for the commercial purpose
alyssa (20:20:46 PM):  ive never ehard of anybody buying anything though for it in terms of chocolate or cards
caroline (20:20:48 PM):  that is truly something you could do any day of the year
melany (20:20:53 PM):  yeah sweetest day seems so crazy to celebrate
lynn (20:20:59 PM):  it's a regional thing, though
meg (20:21:04 PM):  Yeah
melany (20:21:13 PM):  has anyone ever celebrated it before?
alyssa (20:21:23 PM):  nope
meg (20:21:29 PM):  no
ted (20:21:36 PM):  never heard of it
melany (20:21:51 PM):  it would be interesting to go somewhere where they actually celebrate it
melany (20:21:54 PM):  to see what it's like
meg (20:22:02 PM):  did you guys read this one? it's so corporate! link
alyssa (20:22:03 PM):  yea
lynn (20:22:05 PM):  yes, that would be cool to see
caroline (20:22:14 PM):  i think it's odd that it's on a "third saturday" type thing, not a particular day
melany (20:22:34 PM):  yes, very odd
ted (20:22:47 PM):  i don't think is odd at all
meg (20:22:56 PM):  I think its a little funny that they're like, don't put down other people's holidays
meg (20:23:40 PM):  And they have cards for tax day!
meg (20:23:45 PM):  So crazy to me
lynn (20:23:47 PM):  now that's stupid
melany (20:23:48 PM):  it's so ridiculous
melany (20:23:53 PM):  why would u send someone a card for that
alyssa (20:23:56 PM):  cards for tax day?
alyssa (20:23:59 PM):  thats just ridiculous
lynn (20:24:01 PM):  a sympathy card?
meg (20:24:01 PM):  Good luck getting them in on time!
meg (20:24:03 PM):  hahaha
caroline (20:24:08 PM):  hahahahaha that is so dumb
meg (20:24:08 PM):  probably something like that
melany (20:24:32 PM):  bizarre
melany (20:24:39 PM):  what will they come up with next
alyssa (20:24:58 PM):  good luck on ur exams card
alyssa (20:25:03 PM):  i wonder if they have one like that
melany (20:25:10 PM):  haha yeah a "Finals" card
melany (20:25:19 PM):  i think they do for like bar exams actually
caroline (20:25:32 PM):  i can see that deserving a card lol
melany (20:25:37 PM):  yeah exactly
lynn (20:25:54 PM):  yes, on a personal level i can see that too
alyssa (20:25:58 PM):  what about a break up card
alyssa (20:26:08 PM):  sorry didnt have the guts to tell you...but its over
melany (20:26:08 PM):  oh jeez
lynn (20:26:11 PM):  ouch
melany (20:26:12 PM):  horrible
melany (20:26:13 PM):  hahah
melany (20:28:01 PM):  which holiday, of the one's listed, do you think should not be observed?
lynn (20:28:26 PM):  so, does anybody have any strong thoughts on the one hallmark holiday that should be marked for non-observance?
ted (20:28:27 PM):  sweetest day
caroline (20:28:29 PM):  sweetest day
melany (20:28:35 PM):  sweetest day
lynn (20:28:41 PM):  why?
ted (20:28:48 PM):  we are get a concensus
ted (20:29:00 PM):  no need for more sweets
ted (20:29:11 PM):  i would prefer a fitness day
melany (20:29:17 PM):  yeah thats what valentines and halloween is for
melany (20:29:20 PM):  in my opinion
melany (20:29:28 PM):  especially halloween
lynn (20:29:39 PM):  sweetest day seems to be the only one that's very regional in nature
lynn (20:29:56 PM):  unless you consider christmas in july as well
alyssa (20:30:26 PM):  yeah halloween cards sound awesome
melany (20:30:36 PM):  i wish we had someone in the group that had celebrate sweetest day that could try to convince us otherwise
lynn (20:31:22 PM):  yea, maybe we just don't know enough about it
caroline (20:31:26 PM):  well i think it's cute...i'm the type of person who likes to celebrate everything and do nice things whenever i can, but i think it's silly if it's just a way to make money
melany (20:32:10 PM):  yeah holidays are always fun
meg (20:32:28 PM):  Sorry, I had to restart it
alyssa (20:32:47 PM):  its fine
ted (20:33:13 PM):  i like to celebrate them all
melany (20:33:15 PM):  so much money is overspent i think for most of them though
lynn (20:33:21 PM):  if sweetest day is really just about making money, then maybe it should be the one out of all of them to retain its hallmark holiday status
meg (20:33:56 PM):  I think that i'd cross of christmas in july
melany (20:34:09 PM):  yeah i think it's mostly a drinking occassion
melany (20:34:12 PM):  from what i've seen
alyssa (20:34:40 PM):  they should have kegs and eggs cards
melany (20:34:42 PM):  hahaha
melany (20:35:00 PM):  i love st. patrick's day
caroline (20:35:04 PM):  hahaha
ted (20:35:07 PM):  saint patrick's day is approaching
melany (20:35:18 PM):  i cannot wait
ted (20:35:19 PM):  better find some cards soon
lynn (20:35:28 PM):  or a beer
melany (20:35:40 PM):  yeah i think i'll skip out on the cards
meg (20:35:43 PM):  ugh keggs and eggs is so gross in albany
melany (20:35:45 PM):  thats why i like the holiday
alyssa (20:35:47 PM):  lol
lynn (20:35:52 PM):  what is kegs and eggs?
melany (20:35:53 PM):  i feel like it's not about purchasing gifts or cards
melany (20:35:56 PM):  just drinking
melany (20:35:57 PM):  hahaa
ted (20:36:17 PM):  early morning in st. patricks day
meg (20:36:22 PM):  its at the bars downtown, you go out at like 7am
meg (20:36:24 PM):  ugh
melany (20:36:35 PM):  and u get beer thrown all over you
alyssa (20:36:40 PM):  i just turned out 21 yesterday
melany (20:36:41 PM):  gross
caroline (20:36:42 PM):  pretty muvh
alyssa (20:36:46 PM):  and they should have a card
alyssa (20:36:52 PM):  for after 21st
alyssa (20:36:55 PM):  congratulations
meg (20:36:57 PM):  I took the bus back one morning after kegs and eggs and I didn't even realize
alyssa (20:36:58 PM):  on surviving
alyssa (20:37:01 PM):  the 21st
meg (20:37:01 PM):  it was GROSS
melany (20:37:10 PM):  hahaha they probably do have funny 21 cards like that
meg (20:37:13 PM):  Hahaha they do
melany (20:37:14 PM):  they have some good ones i've seen
meg (20:37:17 PM):  I got one like that for my room mate
ted (20:37:41 PM):  guys, when you get a present from someone in the "hallmark holidays," how do you feel?
melany (20:37:51 PM):  i love presents :)
melany (20:37:59 PM):  so i'd be happy regardless of the reason
meg (20:38:04 PM):  Its a little awkward if I don't know them
caroline (20:38:06 PM):  hah
meg (20:38:06 PM):  well
alyssa (20:38:24 PM):  yea as long as its a present
alyssa (20:38:29 PM):  ill be happy
lynn (20:38:31 PM):  i think it's always great to get presents
alyssa (20:38:39 PM):  i actually got a lot of hallmark cards
alyssa (20:38:43 PM):  yesterday i just realized haha
melany (20:38:53 PM):  yeah my mom always sends me cards
melany (20:39:01 PM):  for the smallest of events
caroline (20:39:04 PM):  i do enjoy cards
meg (20:39:09 PM):  I don't care for them
lynn (20:39:17 PM):  cards or presents?
melany (20:39:18 PM):  they are very thoughtful sometimes, it depends
meg (20:39:33 PM):  I end up keeping them for a really long time and then they just collect dust
melany (20:39:41 PM):  yeah that;s true
caroline (20:39:55 PM):  but they're so thoughtful
lynn (20:40:00 PM):  it feels weird to throw them away
melany (20:40:13 PM):  yeah, do you like the funny ones are heartfelt ones more?
meg (20:40:29 PM):  I like the funny ones better
lynn (20:40:38 PM):  if it's really funny, i like those
caroline (20:40:53 PM):  but i feel like they are a nice memory
caroline (20:40:57 PM):  even if they collect dust
melany (20:41:07 PM):  my mom hates the funny ones
lynn (20:41:11 PM):  i hate it that there's so much text in the "heartfelt" ones, they do the speaking for you and sometimes it's so specific
melany (20:41:11 PM):  she finds them useless
ted (20:41:12 PM):  i does fell weird to throw them away. specially if they have a religious image on it. it feels sacrilegous
alyssa (20:41:12 PM):  yeah cause sometimes you lose touch with people
melany (20:41:13 PM):  i like them
alyssa (20:41:19 PM):  and then 10 yeats later
alyssa (20:41:22 PM):  you see the card
alyssa (20:41:32 PM):  and you think of all the memories with the person
melany (20:41:39 PM):  yeah, that's true about the religious cards
melany (20:41:48 PM):  i still have all my communion cards in a box somewhere
meg (20:42:01 PM):  I'm not religious so I don't think I'd keep them
melany (20:42:28 PM):  yeah im sure it depends on the person
ted (20:42:50 PM):  i used to not like cards. and never bought one. until someone gave me a card that was so specific to what i was going thru, that i felt that they do help to express your feelings
caroline (20:43:19 PM):  my thoughts are as ridiculous as some of the listed holidays are--they're mostly all meant to be kind gestures to appreciate someone--except christmas in july
meg (20:43:25 PM):  Id rather give someone a letter
alyssa (20:43:38 PM):  well sometimes i think for people its hard to express
meg (20:43:40 PM):  Or a thoughtful note
alyssa (20:43:41 PM):  their emotions
alyssa (20:43:46 PM):  or feelings in words
alyssa (20:43:49 PM):  or even in a letter
meg (20:44:00 PM):  Yeah
alyssa (20:44:00 PM):  actually i am like that to be honest
alyssa (20:44:09 PM):  so getting a card gets rid of the dilemma
meg (20:44:17 PM):  Hahah yeah I guess
melany (20:44:21 PM):  true
meg (20:44:42 PM):  Which holiday did we decide to get rid of?
lynn (20:44:53 PM):  seems like sweetest day or christmas in july
alyssa (20:44:57 PM):  maybe the sweetest holiday
caroline (20:44:58 PM):  i say get rid of christmas in july
melany (20:45:10 PM):  i can't believe there are cards for christmas in july
meg (20:45:13 PM):  I would get rid of christmas in july
melany (20:45:21 PM):  isn't it the whole month?
lynn (20:45:24 PM):  i'm leaning towards that one, too
melany (20:45:30 PM):  it's not even specific
alyssa (20:45:38 PM):  personally sweetest holiday or christmas in july
alyssa (20:45:44 PM):  i think are both equally dumb
alyssa (20:45:49 PM):  so i would agree with either one
meg (20:45:59 PM):  I think sweetest holiday would be important regionally
caroline (20:46:06 PM):  yes
meg (20:46:43 PM):  so I would keep that one
melany (20:46:44 PM):  yeah, i think it could be important regionally, so christmas in july should go
caroline (20:46:52 PM):  yepp
meg (20:47:50 PM):  what about valentine's day
caroline (20:47:58 PM):  keep
meg (20:48:01 PM):  are we keeping it?
melany (20:48:03 PM):  i think some sentiment definetly lies behind it
melany (20:48:11 PM):  i'd keep it
meg (20:48:15 PM):  I don't know if they should keep it the same though
alyssa (20:48:16 PM):  yea v day should be kept i guess
meg (20:48:42 PM):  I don't like how roses are for v-day
ted (20:48:46 PM):  yes keep v day (heart)
melany (20:48:50 PM):  what do you think the appropriate gift is for vday?
lynn (20:49:11 PM):  hm, i think it depends on the person, anything that is meaningful to them
meg (20:49:16 PM):  I think breakfast in bed is perfect!!!
melany (20:49:28 PM):  that sounds lovely
caroline (20:49:30 PM):  i think the gift should be unique
alyssa (20:49:30 PM):  a nice diamond necklace haha
melany (20:49:33 PM):  hahaha
caroline (20:49:35 PM):  hahaha
melany (20:49:44 PM):  jewlery is always nice
ted (20:49:48 PM):  a trip to the caribean
melany (20:50:02 PM):  should the female buy something for the male?
meg (20:50:03 PM):  I don't like jewelry lol
caroline (20:50:08 PM):  absolutely!
lynn (20:50:11 PM):  sure, why not!
caroline (20:50:15 PM):  i think the girl holiday sentiment is crap1
meg (20:50:28 PM):  I think so, girls should at least do something nice too
melany (20:50:35 PM):  yeah me too
ted (20:50:41 PM):  in some cultures the girls do not buy anything for the guy.
melany (20:50:47 PM):  i was suprised this year when people were telling me not to buy anything
meg (20:50:59 PM):  I brought my bf to the baseball hall of fame for v-day
meg (20:51:04 PM):  he loves baseball
melany (20:51:10 PM):  thats very thoughtful
meg (20:51:17 PM):  I'd rather do somehting like that
melany (20:51:29 PM):  yeah, i went to atlantic city
melany (20:51:32 PM):  that was nice
caroline (20:51:32 PM):  very nice
meg (20:51:36 PM):  awesome
melany (20:51:54 PM):  i think spending time is more important than spending money, as cheesy as that sounds
meg (20:51:54 PM):  he got me season one of my new favorite show!
melany (20:52:01 PM):  ah i love tv on dvd!
meg (20:52:09 PM):  its true

meg (21:16:33 PM):  ugh they're annoying
caroline (21:17:19 PM):  i would rather get a real card, but i think e-cards are perfect for some occasions
meg (21:17:23 PM):  I used to love those little cards
lynn (21:17:35 PM):  "will you be my valentine?"
rita (21:17:43 PM):  E-cards are fun for b-days ... but in general I only like them for B-days or if they have photos of people you know in them

melany (21:23:14 PM):  i dont think i can decide on a favorite card
rita (21:23:14 PM):  As life goes by you just accumulate so many acquaintances
meg (21:23:23 PM):  "I want you to be scared of how much you love me"
meg (21:23:24 PM):  hahah
ted (21:23:27 PM):  it was an "I miss you card"
caroline (21:23:28 PM):  the "just because" ones
melany (21:23:32 PM):  i love cards with the beach on them
melany (21:24:48 PM):  'so tonight's discussion has led us to believe that christmas in july should no longer be a hallmark holiday, correct?
rita (21:24:48 PM):  When I lived in Maryland there was a drug store across the street from my work that had this machine you could use a connect computer to personal a greeting card and then the machine would draw it for you with magic markers on the card stock.
rita (21:24:59 PM):  It was hysterical and we used it all the time
meg (21:25:00 PM):  correct melany
melany (21:25:02 PM):  oh yes we have those in NY too
lynn (21:25:09 PM):  yes,, melany
meg (21:25:16 PM):  omg, that is really cute rita
meg (21:25:22 PM):  I would totally do that
caroline (21:25:26 PM):  that sounds so cool!
rita (21:25:54 PM):  You could name the characters on the templates they had and choose hair colors and stuff ... it was really fun
meg (21:25:59 PM):  aww
meg (21:26:05 PM):  that sounds fun haha
rita (21:26:14 PM):  I still have the card my co-workers made when I left that job
meg (21:26:25 PM):  aww
ted (21:26:26 PM):  those cards are cool.
meg (21:26:28 PM):  thats cute
lynn (21:26:36 PM):  yea, ,those group cards are fun
rita (21:27:06 PM):  I've been making cards in MS Publisher
meg (21:27:11 PM):  thats fun
melany (21:27:26 PM):  i used to use ms publisher
lynn (21:27:29 PM):  wish i could do that
rita (21:27:39 PM):  I made the Baptism invitations for my daughter's Baptism on Publisher and printed them on card stock at Staples to save money
meg (21:27:45 PM):  I like making them from scratch
melany (21:27:47 PM):  great idea
rita (21:27:53 PM):  They were cute and had her picture on them
caroline (21:27:55 PM):  definitely
moderator (21:28:03 PM):  Hi all, as we near the end of discussion, I'd like to remind everyone that there's a survey to be filled out before you leave.
ted (21:28:04 PM):  i should learn photoshop, or flash. to make my own vivid designs
moderator (21:28:05 PM):  link

lynn (21:29:16 PM):  christmas in july
rita (21:29:21 PM):  Cool - sounds good to me
caroline (21:29:28 PM):  the people don't seem to be matching up on the survey
caroline (21:29:35 PM):  anyone else having this problem?
melany (21:29:50 PM):  i am!
melany (21:30:00 PM):  i have different people
meg (21:30:06 PM):  me neither
meg (21:30:13 PM):  some of them
moderator (21:30:23 PM):  whoopsie
moderator (21:30:28 PM):  wrong link
moderator (21:30:33 PM):  link
ted (21:30:43 PM):  i think we have the right link
melany (21:30:47 PM):  thanks!
ted (21:31:00 PM):  some people are right and some are unknown to me
meg (21:31:22 PM):  the second link is right
ted (21:31:24 PM):  maybe due to nick names?
moderator (21:31:46 PM):  Hi all, the second link I sent should be the correct one

moderator (21:31:57 PM):  link

moderator (19:48:41 PM):  link
meg (20:01:29 PM):  hi all
melany (20:01:35 PM):  hello
lynn (20:01:37 PM):  hi
david (20:01:38 PM):  hi
moderator (20:02:17 PM):  Hi guys, since there are four of you here, I think you can begin and others may join in later.
meg (20:02:25 PM):  Ok
lynn (20:02:31 PM):  ok
melany (20:02:35 PM):  ok
moderator (20:02:39 PM):  Let's see, david, would you mind leading today?
david (20:03:02 PM):  okay
rita (20:03:04 PM):  hi
luke (20:03:10 PM):  hello
meg (20:03:17 PM):  hi
lynn (20:03:18 PM):  hi
meg (20:03:19 PM):  :)
melany (20:03:22 PM):  hi
moderator (20:03:27 PM):  Great, thanks! You guys can begin.
moderator (20:03:42 PM):  luke, would you mind joining Group A actually.
david (20:03:46 PM):  i'm "leading" - this takes more effort - okay, lets get started - i'll give this a shot
moderator (20:04:06 PM):  There's one person less there right now, we need at least four in a group. :-)
david (20:04:07 PM):  you've noticed five categories to divide tax dollar resources
luke (20:04:08 PM):  okkk
meg (20:04:24 PM):  YEAH
meg (20:04:27 PM):  woops
david (20:04:36 PM):  one option is to make it simple, and allot an even 20% of funds to each - does anyone feel this is a good idea?
david (20:04:45 PM):  or do you think some of these services are more important than others?
rita (20:04:54 PM):  I'm a librarian so ...
david (20:04:55 PM):  don't be shy
melany (20:04:58 PM):  i thought of the 20 percent right away
david (20:05:02 PM):  i'm a librarian too
meg (20:05:11 PM):  I feel like its more important to give some more to other things
david (20:05:17 PM):  so i guess i;ll declare myself biased in that sense
melany (20:05:30 PM):  yeah were probably supposed to do different percentages
meg (20:05:36 PM):  water and sewer probably need more things
lynn (20:05:36 PM):  i don't think so, only because i think some things require many more resources than others
lynn (20:05:45 PM):  as meg said
rita (20:05:54 PM):  So ... :-) 90% to the library, right?
david (20:05:56 PM):  meg - what do you feel should be short changed compared to others - and what examples -
david (20:06:18 PM):  make it 99% :-D
rita (20:06:24 PM):  LOL - not really, we have to get to work on roads and use toilets
meg (20:06:39 PM):  unfortunately I thing that the library needs less resources
melany (20:06:42 PM):  yeah two important aspects
meg (20:06:48 PM):  Because they can always use independent donations
david (20:07:03 PM):  senior citizen services are crucial, yet they don't compose even 20% of the population in a typical town/city
meg (20:07:15 PM):  agreed
david (20:07:22 PM):  all of these services can rely on independent donations
melany (20:07:22 PM):  true
lynn (20:07:39 PM):  what items could use more federal dollars?
meg (20:07:47 PM):  I'd say that road, water/sewers and the refuse need the most money
rita (20:07:50 PM):  Philanthropists will take care of the seniors
melany (20:08:00 PM):  haha
david (20:08:12 PM):  this is really related to city council distribution of funds, federal funds and grants are a different matter
lynn (20:08:13 PM):  they'd probably take care of the libraries
melany (20:08:34 PM):  i agree
david (20:08:38 PM):  seniors typically have the most resources and are better able to take care of themselves, financially at least, than any other segment of the population
lynn (20:08:38 PM):  i know, but what i'm saying is that some fed grants may be very easy to get, and if you get money via fed dollars,
lynn (20:08:42 PM):  you could use less city dollars
david (20:08:53 PM):  seniors are the most powerful group - so lets give them say, 10% of the funds, max
rita (20:09:04 PM):  If you take a look at how much of my household income goes to water/sewer, refuse, and recycling it is really small ... I mean what the city charges us
melany (20:09:05 PM):  good idea david
david (20:09:06 PM):  does anyone think that is too much?
meg (20:09:15 PM):  I think itd be easier if we knew houw much the budget was
meg (20:09:21 PM):  I think its alright
david (20:09:41 PM):  yes, dont a lot of municipalities also have their residents use a private firm for recycling and trash disposition?
david (20:09:56 PM):  yes, knowing a figure for the budget would make this easier -
david (20:10:16 PM):  it's one thing to know how these stand in relation to each other, percentages - but the actual figure would be more helpful
lynn (20:10:18 PM):  i would vote for a slighly higher amount for senior services
david (20:10:25 PM):  why?
lynn (20:10:26 PM):  maybe 12-15%
rita (20:10:34 PM):  We have the option of private or city ... for city garbage we actually purchase blue city bags at the grocery store that your trash has to go in
rita (20:10:58 PM):  small ones are 2:75 and large are 3.50
lynn (20:11:03 PM):  because i would put the lowest allocation to refuse and recycling
rita (20:11:09 PM):  $2.75 and $3.50
lynn (20:11:14 PM):  senior services requires a lot more personnel i think
david (20:11:20 PM):  yeah - there are often both options and residents have choice, or maybe a hybrid option
melany (20:11:39 PM):  hmm
david (20:11:39 PM):  yeah - seniors really need no more than 10% , even that would be generous
meg (20:11:43 PM):  Yeah, but its a lower pecentage of the population
melany (20:11:45 PM):  i dont think they do
david (20:11:57 PM):  how much of the community uses the library? i'd say
david (20:12:05 PM):  a lot bigger percentage than there are of just seniors alone
melany (20:12:18 PM):  i agree
melany (20:12:28 PM):  i think the library could be benefited more than the seniors
lynn (20:12:32 PM):  but seniors are more likely to have health issues, and that gets expensive, requires more personnel
melany (20:12:34 PM):  aka needs more funds
meg (20:12:51 PM):  thats true
david (20:12:55 PM):  why devote all these resources to one, small segment of the populatiion, who are so wealthy in comparison?
melany (20:13:17 PM):  good poit
meg (20:13:17 PM):  who agrees that the libraries don't need as much?
melany (20:13:18 PM):  point*
david (20:13:19 PM):  health issues? they have Medicare
rita (20:13:32 PM):  Lets approach this in a different way ... let's say each gets 20% and then decide if we take 5% away from one who do we give it to
lynn (20:13:42 PM):  are seniors wealthy?
meg (20:13:47 PM):  Thats a good idea
melany (20:13:49 PM):  thats a good plan
rita (20:13:52 PM):  many seniors are not wealthy
david (20:14:02 PM):  no, they are not wealthy
lynn (20:14:03 PM):  my parents have medicare and it pays for practically nothing
david (20:14:10 PM):  they are wealthy in comparison to everyone else in the population
rita (20:14:26 PM):  So if Refuse and Recycling only needs 10% where should we spend that 10%
david (20:14:29 PM):  they have the most years of income, the most education, and pensions - they are the most powerful group in the United States today
lynn (20:14:41 PM):  i'm not sure i agree with that, i would think it's more the 40-50 age range that are wealthier
melany (20:14:46 PM):  i think highway and roads are important
david (20:14:46 PM):  well - they have pensions and employment to pay for their health insurabce
rita (20:14:55 PM):  I know so many poor seniors on fixed incomes - it's really sad
lynn (20:15:02 PM):  me too
david (20:15:05 PM):  even if medicare pays for nothing, it's better than having no govt. health insurance, which the rest of the population has
rita (20:15:22 PM):  I feel like there are other public services that should be on this list that are not
lynn (20:15:28 PM):  agreed, but i still think they would have more potential health problems
david (20:15:38 PM):  perhaps those services are already determined
david (20:15:42 PM):  the resources
melany (20:15:45 PM):  perhaps
melany (20:16:24 PM):  if everyone had to pick one as the most important, what would u pick?
david (20:16:24 PM):  so - maybe public libraries - we can fix that at 40% - who disagrees?
meg (20:16:31 PM):  ,,,..//
david (20:16:44 PM):  public libraries is most important - what is everyone else's vote
david (20:16:55 PM):  please voice your vote
meg (20:17:23 PM):  sorry
melany (20:17:30 PM):  hmmm sorry still deciding
meg (20:17:30 PM):  My computer freaked for a minute
rita (20:17:32 PM):  Libraries can work consortially to cut costs
lynn (20:17:41 PM):  i think sewer and water are more important, even though i love libraries
melany (20:17:49 PM):  i think so too lynn
melany (20:17:58 PM):  there can be alot of issues with sewer and water
meg (20:18:05 PM):  I agree with melany
melany (20:18:38 PM):  very expensive issues haha
rita (20:19:01 PM):  I have a big house and get a sewer and water bill every three months that only costs like $120 - I don't think sewer and water require that much $ or our bill would be higher
david (20:19:01 PM):  we dont even have the population of this town/city
david (20:19:14 PM):  so it makes it more difficult, the lack of info.
melany (20:19:18 PM):  thats a good point david
lynn (20:19:21 PM):  but every single person uses them, not every single person uses libraries or senior services
melany (20:19:56 PM):  yes a necessity
meg (20:19:57 PM):  its true
rita (20:19:59 PM):  Everyone should use the library :-)
david (20:20:14 PM):  - every person may use water and sewer, but those costs are also dispersed - and different municipalities share these costs - nyc gets it water from an aquafur - and
david (20:20:34 PM):  upstate ny gets it from underground as well as reservoirs, which are all shared by many towns and cities
meg (20:20:51 PM):  No one can disagree that the roads need a lot of work
meg (20:21:00 PM):  I think they need the most money
meg (20:21:09 PM):  (Unless you do disagree lol)
rita (20:21:15 PM):  Libraries also share resouces - like state wide consortial agreements and lending
lynn (20:21:25 PM):  but they are way more expensive to maintain
david (20:21:31 PM):  roads - it doesnt even specify annual snowfall amounts
melany (20:21:45 PM):  very difficult to decide when population and climate arent addressed
rita (20:22:00 PM):  Well won't we all be driving hover cars in like a year
lynn (20:22:06 PM):  haha
lynn (20:22:14 PM):  would be cool
meg (20:22:23 PM):  hahaha nice
david (20:22:38 PM):  if you shot change the library, it can actually increase crime and juvenile delinquency - which impacts the community, and there are other issues too of course
david (20:23:21 PM):  all these services are important, to me - the only thing really clear is that senior citizen services deserve the least
melany (20:23:47 PM):  i agree with david
melany (20:24:14 PM):  what do we think of recycling?
rita (20:24:14 PM):  One question - what percentage of each item's operating budget comes from the taxes?
lynn (20:24:14 PM):  i don't think i agree with that
melany (20:24:19 PM):  does that need a lot of funding?
melany (20:24:28 PM):  im contemplating about that being the least funded
david (20:24:33 PM):  how about 30% for libraries - 30% for water and sewer - 30% for highway and road - 8% for refuse and recylcing - and 2% for senior citizen services
lynn (20:24:42 PM):  i wouldn't vote for that
lynn (20:24:46 PM):  no way
rita (20:24:47 PM):  Like which ones have alternate sources of funding
david (20:25:01 PM):  keep in mind, 2% can be a lot - 2% of 2 million is $40,000 - which is more than adequate
david (20:25:20 PM):  why wouldn't you vote for that lynn?
david (20:25:26 PM):  what would you change and why?
lynn (20:25:29 PM):  2% for senior services?
david (20:25:56 PM):  yeah - i can tell you that might a bigger percentage than your hometown devotes to senior services
david (20:26:08 PM):  senior services? that's such a joke - there's no such thing, there really is it
melany (20:26:30 PM):  how much do u think their living facicilites cost?
david (20:26:37 PM):  towns have Senior Centers - but seniors already are given federal resources through medicare
meg (20:26:39 PM):  I think it needs a lot more
david (20:27:01 PM):  compare senior services to schools
meg (20:27:12 PM):  But we're not paying for schools
david (20:27:16 PM):  in Niskayuna, senior services receive about 1% of the town budget
david (20:27:30 PM):  no, we're not paying for schools
david (20:27:45 PM):  i'm just pointing out that senior services are really not a priority or interest for most citizens
meg (20:27:53 PM):  How about this: 5% for seniors
david (20:28:00 PM):  the emphasis is really more on children
david (20:28:07 PM):  and school aged kids
david (20:28:51 PM):  5% is manageable, i'd be willing to compromise - but that really should be the maximum - anything more is a joke, otherwise you just turn the town into an assisted living luxury center - instead of private, now public financed
irene (20:29:03 PM):  are we talking about the world
irene (20:29:11 PM):  i was in the wrong chat
melany (20:29:17 PM):  its a community i believe
irene (20:29:18 PM):  *europe
meg (20:29:19 PM):  we're talking about financial budget
meg (20:29:23 PM):  for a town
melany (20:29:24 PM):  for a city
david (20:29:27 PM):  right
meg (20:29:29 PM):  and how to split it all up
melany (20:29:33 PM):  it says "the city council" so yeah a town or city
melany (20:29:39 PM):  link
melany (20:32:15 PM):  so we agreed 5 percent for senior citizens?
david (20:32:39 PM):  yeah
david (20:32:42 PM):  5 percent it is
melany (20:32:48 PM):  okay so now the rest of the 95 percent haha
melany (20:33:06 PM):  how much should roads and higways recieve?
meg (20:33:10 PM):  I'd say 8% for senior citizens, 10% for refuse, 20% to roads, 20% to water and sewer, 12% libraries
meg (20:33:19 PM):  It took me a while to figure that lol
meg (20:33:31 PM):  but anything is good with that
david (20:33:33 PM):  the figure for refuse is way too high
lynn (20:33:36 PM):  wait, i don't think that's 100, is it?
meg (20:33:46 PM):  HAhaha
david (20:33:47 PM):  no
david (20:33:50 PM):  haha
lynn (20:33:51 PM):  i agree with meg
meg (20:33:52 PM):  I'm really good at math some nights
meg (20:34:02 PM):  I'm pocketing the leftovers
david (20:34:07 PM):  haha
melany (20:34:40 PM):  i think 8 percent would be max for reuse
rita (20:34:43 PM):  I agree with meg
meg (20:35:15 PM):  8% sounds alright with me
david (20:35:35 PM):  8 is more reasonable, that is a good amount
rita (20:35:40 PM):  But it is so weird that they have left out items like schools, hospitals, parks and recreation, etc
melany (20:36:00 PM):  i know!
melany (20:36:05 PM):  very odd
rita (20:36:29 PM):  What about law enforcement
meg (20:36:34 PM):  I think those are federally
david (20:36:36 PM):  yeah - maybe those are static every year, hopefully not! - maybe they are decided through a different process, than by a bunch of people on chat, haha
rita (20:36:37 PM):  What about firemen
david (20:36:39 PM):  so - i'd say
david (20:36:49 PM):  divide the rest evenly
david (20:37:05 PM):  5 to seniors , 8 to recyylcing, and the remained split evenly
melany (20:37:29 PM):  i agree
rita (20:37:29 PM):  A bunch of people who do not have enough information about the situation
meg (20:37:55 PM):  what's the rest??
meg (20:38:00 PM):  divided?
meg (20:38:31 PM):  29% each
david (20:38:54 PM):  yeah, so thats a good plan - right?
meg (20:39:01 PM):  Sounds good to me
lynn (20:39:05 PM):  sorry, i don't agree with that
melany (20:39:31 PM):  what do you propose lynn?
melany (20:39:45 PM):  we've certainly got time to debate! haha
rita (20:40:26 PM):  Is this what you are saying? Seniors 5%, Refuse and Recycling 8%, Libraries 12%, Water and Sewer 37.5%, and Highway and Roads 37.5 %
lynn (20:40:55 PM):  i'd be more likely to agree to that
david (20:41:39 PM):  so you're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on roads? instead of on education and culture , accessible through the library to the widest group of people?
lynn (20:41:51 PM):  a water sewage treatment plant, more than one water storage tanks, a purification plant
david (20:41:56 PM):  doesn't seem like good priorities - the roads are maintained with less
lynn (20:41:58 PM):  those are unbelievably expensive
david (20:42:17 PM):  I'd say we eliminate our plan
lynn (20:42:22 PM):  how many libraries are we talking about??
lynn (20:42:29 PM):  no not roads
david (20:42:36 PM):  let's spend 100% on military and defense
rita (20:42:37 PM):  Or Seniors 5%, Refuse and Recycling 8%, Libraries 27%, Water and Sewer 35%, and Highway and Roads 35%
rita (20:42:45 PM):  I got confused
melany (20:42:50 PM):  haha
lynn (20:42:51 PM):  the schools are surely responsible for some oft he education and culture
david (20:43:04 PM):  yeah, some
lynn (20:43:09 PM):  no need to be sarcastic
lynn (20:43:30 PM):  i work in the arts, for a non=profit, a big believer in the arts
meg (20:43:57 PM):  I like that
david (20:44:01 PM):  what would happen if you went to fairfield, CT or north jersey, or any affluent place - and u took away their community library - they'd be mad -- but this is actually universal -- all towns devote a good percentage to libraries -
melany (20:44:24 PM):  this is a tricky plan to devise
melany (20:44:30 PM):  with so little information
lynn (20:44:31 PM):  i'm just saying that if the water treatment plants, etc. aren't properly maintained, you have some serious problems on your hand and some serious fallout
lynn (20:44:54 PM):  if a library had problems, the community could get by until a solution was found, it wouldn't have health implications, etc
melany (20:44:59 PM):  and that would affect everyone, even those that dont use a library
lynn (20:45:26 PM):  i volunteer at a library and know that volunteers are a big part of that system
lynn (20:46:05 PM):  and somebody else mentioned earlier that they can easily work with other libraries, share resources. they are linked to other regional libraries
rita (20:46:17 PM):  So what are we deciding
david (20:46:46 PM):  that makes it more expensive, to share resources is a lot of transportation and technology costs - towns also share water resources
lynn (20:47:43 PM):  yes, but i don't see how libraries, even highly technologized ones, require more money than water treatment plants, equipment for water sewage, etc.
david (20:48:16 PM):  okay, so we'll make water resources more
lynn (20:48:47 PM):  what are the big expensese for libraries?
melany (20:48:52 PM):  what will providing the library with a large amount of funding provide?
rita (20:49:07 PM):  subscriptions to electronic reseources
rita (20:49:14 PM):  resources
meg (20:49:14 PM):  that sounds nice
meg (20:49:22 PM):  I think libraries need more too
meg (20:49:39 PM):  books are expensive
lynn (20:50:13 PM):  but how many books are being bought new each year?
david (20:50:22 PM):  if u consider that nyc spends $262 million annually on water, thats a lot - but i dont know how it compares to other areas
melany (20:50:27 PM):  wiw
melany (20:50:30 PM):  wow*
melany (20:50:33 PM):  thats alot
rita (20:50:33 PM):  over 30% of your university's library budget is most likely spent on subscriptions to online databases and periodicals
rita (20:51:26 PM):  The largest operating cost for most of these agencies is staffing
melany (20:51:33 PM):  interesting
rita (20:51:54 PM):  Each employee needs salary, health benefits, vacation ertc
rita (20:52:02 PM):  etc
lynn (20:52:11 PM):  right, but same for the city employees who work at the plants
david (20:52:18 PM):  the New York Public Library has over $50 billion in annual public spending., which totally dwards all water costs for the city
lynn (20:52:20 PM):  or the senior services centers, for that matter
lynn (20:52:41 PM):  but how much of that is from the city?
rita (20:53:03 PM):  How many donations did the NYPL receive last year?
lynn (20:53:23 PM):  and that's the nyc public library, which probably has rich donations behind it
david (20:53:24 PM):  i was joking
rita (20:53:45 PM):  david you are on fire
david (20:53:46 PM):  yes, it has rich donations
melany (20:54:00 PM):  haha
david (20:54:03 PM):  it wasnt intended to be humorous
meg (20:54:12 PM):  lol
melany (20:55:06 PM):  we need to start working toward a consensus that we can agree on for the most part
meg (20:55:20 PM):  agreed
lynn (20:55:23 PM):  yes
rita (20:56:19 PM):  Ok so say we revisit giving each 20% right out of the box ... then we take 15% away from seniors, and 10% away from Refuse and Recycling ... so Water and Sewer 20%, Highway and Roads 20%, Libraries 20% where do we spend the 25% extra?
rita (20:57:03 PM):  Or should we say ...
meg (20:57:05 PM):  How about 5% each back to all?
lynn (20:57:48 PM):  this is what somebody proposed earlier, i like this the best of what we've discussed so far: Seniors 5%, Refuse and Recycling 8%, Libraries 12%, Water and Sewer 37.5%, and Highway and Roads 37.5 %
melany (20:57:57 PM):  i like that one the best as well
meg (20:58:03 PM):  so 10% to seniors, 15% to refuse and recycling and the rest have 25%
david (20:58:42 PM):  well, water and sewer , roads - those should be high - but recycling seems too high, isn't a lot of that privatized anyway?
rita (20:58:46 PM):  I like meg's idea
meg (20:59:10 PM):  I don't know, the whole recycling movement has taken off I think funding should be directed there more too
rita (20:59:15 PM):  Yes but it's not just recycling ... it garbage too
lynn (20:59:21 PM):  right
rita (20:59:30 PM):  Landfills are expensive
david (20:59:31 PM):  right - like in most municipalities - you pay for it yourself
rita (21:00:07 PM):  But , as in back to the future, in a year we can put the trash in the car for gas - right
melany (21:00:16 PM):  haha true
david (21:00:17 PM):  there are trash collection stations, those are sort of supported by the town - but i know in Guiderland and Niskayuna for example,
meg (21:00:28 PM):  Yeah but Albany has city collection
david (21:00:37 PM):  your taxes DO NOT pay for trash pick up or recycling pick up and disposition, nor processing - thats all done by yourself
david (21:00:48 PM):  Albany City? really
meg (21:00:54 PM):  Yes
david (21:00:59 PM):  wow, so the city pays for that? -
meg (21:01:00 PM):  I don't pay for trash at all
david (21:01:37 PM):  thats pretty good - so maybe you'd allocate some money there, in this particular case
melany (21:01:43 PM):  me either
meg (21:02:08 PM):  if we're talking about a city, then getting rid of trash is important
david (21:02:11 PM):  the town does own and operate a transfer station, but the percentage is proly too high - i wont quibble on details though , it might make sense just to make this easy
rita (21:02:22 PM):  I think I am deciding that Highways and Roads need the most
rita (21:02:44 PM):  Water and Sewer next
rita (21:02:58 PM):  And the Library and Seniors on the next tier
david (21:03:02 PM):  yeah, with the way Americans drive and how this is so car-centric and theres so much sprawl and lack of public transportation and high speed trains that europe and asia has, we should spend a lot more on roads
melany (21:03:28 PM):  true
melany (21:03:29 PM):  good point
rita (21:03:43 PM):  Hey ... they tried to build a monorail system through downtown Seattle and the tax payers shot it down
rita (21:03:49 PM):  It was soooo expensive
meg (21:03:57 PM):  hahaha i'm not surprised
melany (21:04:08 PM):  yeah sounds like it
rita (21:04:25 PM):  Even in places like Seattle with TONS of public transportation people won't use it
david (21:04:30 PM):  american cities dont have rails
lynn (21:04:34 PM):  how about this?: Seniors 8%, Refuse and Recycling 10%, Libraries 15%, Water and Sewer 34.5%, and Highway and Roads 30.5 %
rita (21:04:39 PM):  They had insentives were you could get paid to take it
lynn (21:04:44 PM):  this is a mixture of what some people said before
david (21:04:51 PM):  ny is really the only true exception
lynn (21:05:05 PM):  although the water and highway might be switched based on what was just said
rita (21:05:07 PM):  You mean NYC
meg (21:05:11 PM):  no, there's a whole rail system in san francisco
rita (21:05:11 PM):  or NY
david (21:05:16 PM):  no New York
lynn (21:05:17 PM):  chicago too
rita (21:05:27 PM):  I live in Cortland
david (21:05:29 PM):  a lot of people refer to it just simply as New York
rita (21:05:41 PM):  and there is no public transportation
rita (21:06:04 PM):  There are short buses for the disables and that is it
david (21:06:04 PM):  NYC is like if you're going to differentiate b/n upstate and downstate, but upstate is not really that important in comparison
david (21:06:16 PM):  so most people in the U.S. - when they say New York, it means the city, not the state
david (21:06:35 PM):  who cares about NYS? people care about New York (the city, not the state)
meg (21:06:37 PM):  lol, not to us new york staters
rita (21:06:40 PM):  That is why I asked and you said the state
rita (21:06:47 PM):  but you mean the city
meg (21:06:47 PM):  the rest of use care about the giant state too
meg (21:06:48 PM):  !
meg (21:06:50 PM):  :)
david (21:07:01 PM):  yeah, but New York states are the minority when you're talking about a country of 300 million people that views New York as the city
david (21:07:11 PM):  i care about it too, New York State
david (21:07:16 PM):  definitely
david (21:07:20 PM):  so anyway -
rita (21:07:23 PM):  you lost me
melany (21:07:25 PM):  me too
melany (21:07:27 PM):  soooo
melany (21:07:30 PM):  back to the percentages?
meg (21:07:32 PM):  lol
lynn (21:07:48 PM):  how about this? - Seniors 8%, Refuse and Recycling 10%, Libraries 15%, Water and Sewer 34.5%, and Highway and Roads 30.5 %
lynn (21:08:03 PM):  or swtich highways and water, based on recent conversations
david (21:08:19 PM):  no, you got to take 3 % away from seniors, give it to roads
david (21:08:28 PM):  or something else, 8% is too high
meg (21:08:48 PM):  Or one percent away from everything else, and that 4and to roads
lynn (21:09:07 PM):  ok, i'd go with that, meg
lynn (21:09:17 PM):  than water/sewer and highways are about equal again
david (21:09:22 PM):  no, roads are covered
david (21:09:26 PM):  roads dont need more
david (21:09:33 PM):  especially bc the town pays for town roads
meg (21:09:36 PM):  I disagree
meg (21:09:43 PM):  roads are such a high expense
lynn (21:09:44 PM):  i thought you said to give 4 to roads earlier?
david (21:09:46 PM):  but roads in the town that are county roads, that connect towns, or that are part of interstates, those are all
david (21:09:56 PM):  paid for by the state and tolls, and
david (21:10:04 PM):  u also have federal roads and federal grants
meg (21:10:16 PM):  I'm from upstate, and country town roads are obnoxious, 4 % more would go to plowing in winter, and potholes
rita (21:10:25 PM):  Roads include other things too, "In addition to its efficient snow removal and aggressive paving program, the Highway Department provides other seasonal programs such as spring cleanup, summer yard waste pickup, fall leaf pickup and snow and ice removal. Highway personnel are also responsible for the upkeep of 32 miles of sidewalks, as well as the maintenance of over 180 vehicles and equipment owned by the various Town departments."
meg (21:10:35 PM):  agreed
david (21:10:49 PM):  yeah, so then
david (21:11:04 PM):  remove the remaining percentage from seniors, and give it to roads - keep seniors at 4 or 5 %
david (21:12:08 PM):  the reason new york state is bankrupt right now, is because tax payers are paying pensions and health care for people who retired 30 years ago
lynn (21:12:11 PM):  sorry, now you are making seniors even less, i liked meg's idea better of 1 percent from everything, making seniors 7, refuse 9, libraries 14, .......water 33 and roads 34
david (21:12:24 PM):  20 yrs ago and up
meg (21:12:34 PM):  I think its more fair to compromise and take 1% from everything
david (21:12:36 PM):  7% on seniors, thats absurd
david (21:12:44 PM):  what are you going to do with the roads? they're a mess
lynn (21:12:55 PM):  they have the highest allocation, though
david (21:13:00 PM):  7% on seniors, thats crazy i think
david (21:13:31 PM):  well , if roads are too much, give some to water
meg (21:13:34 PM):  yes, but there's a certain point of compromise that needs to happen with these discussion
melany (21:13:49 PM):  true
rita (21:14:12 PM):  We have 16 minutes to come to an agreement
david (21:14:19 PM):  right, and thats why we're appealng to your reason, so that you may compromise and negotiate an amicable solution -- instead of grid lock demanding 90% for seniors
lynn (21:14:35 PM):  wait, i wasn't demanding 90 for seniors
meg (21:14:38 PM):  lol we're not demanding 80% though hahaha
david (21:14:47 PM):  like, hand over fist, extortion, ultimatum tactics
rita (21:14:53 PM):  If anyone is taking this way to seriously it's not us
david (21:14:58 PM):  yeah i know, i'm just bored
melany (21:15:06 PM):  well we need to decide on something
david (21:15:07 PM):  still - 7% is proly a tad high for seniors
david (21:15:35 PM):  i think we could break that down , just a dite, reinvest the money in our roads and water treatment programs
meg (21:16:08 PM):  i don't know, i mean, you'll be a senior one day too what if they get rid of your funding
meg (21:16:09 PM):  ??
lynn (21:16:11 PM):  seniors 6, refuse 9, libraries 14, .......water 34 and roads 34
lynn (21:16:14 PM):  right
rita (21:16:18 PM):  david - just type up your ideal percentages and let the rest of us roll it around for a minute
lynn (21:16:26 PM):  i have no idea if that's 100, i've lost track
melany (21:16:27 PM):  good idea rita
david (21:16:52 PM):  well - i dont know what kind of additional funding seniors are entitlted too - they already receive more funding than any other portion of the population
david (21:17:11 PM):  they vote in the highest percentage and are clearly the most powerful, influential, and wealthy group of american society
lynn (21:17:15 PM):  6 is a reduction from 7
rita (21:17:24 PM):  Well we can see who will be winning an AARP award this year
meg (21:17:33 PM):  lol
rita (21:17:47 PM):  13 minutes
david (21:17:49 PM):  maybe we should fund AARP, just funnel the money to AARP
david (21:17:54 PM):  haha
lynn (21:18:01 PM):  ok, so does anybody have any comments on the last figures?
lynn (21:18:16 PM):  seniors 6, refuse 9, libraries 14, .......water 34 and roads 34
melany (21:18:35 PM):  i think thats fair and reasonable
david (21:18:38 PM):  yeah, thats better - it's an improvment
rita (21:18:39 PM):  the S6, Re9, L14, W34 and Ro34?
david (21:18:41 PM):  yeah -
meg (21:18:46 PM):  sounds good
david (21:18:47 PM):  thanks for the stats rita
meg (21:18:50 PM):  I'm fine with that
lynn (21:18:53 PM):  but let me check that it's 100
melany (21:18:54 PM):  great
meg (21:18:56 PM):  it is
meg (21:18:59 PM):  I think
lynn (21:19:02 PM):  oh wow,
meg (21:19:04 PM):  but my math skills are so good tonight
lynn (21:19:20 PM):  no, it's not
lynn (21:19:21 PM):  hold on
rita (21:19:32 PM):  it's 97
meg (21:19:33 PM):  +1?
meg (21:19:48 PM):  Clearly i am too sleep derived for arithmetic
rita (21:20:08 PM):  So we have 3 more %
melany (21:20:14 PM):  hahhaa
rita (21:20:15 PM):  Where to spend it
meg (21:20:19 PM):  Uhm, +1 each to library, water, and roads?
rita (21:20:27 PM):  sounds good to me
melany (21:20:27 PM):  thats what i was thinking
lynn (21:20:30 PM):  i'd rather bump seniors back up to 7
lynn (21:20:35 PM):  but whatever, it's 1
lynn (21:20:37 PM):  percent
lynn (21:20:47 PM):  and time is almost up
david (21:21:04 PM):  nah, 7 - its really unprecedented
rita (21:21:06 PM):  S6 Re9, L15,W35, Ro35?
meg (21:21:09 PM):  yes
david (21:21:10 PM):  it would be very radical
meg (21:21:15 PM):  agreed
david (21:21:16 PM):  especially in a state other than FL
lynn (21:21:24 PM):  i agreed to it
rita (21:21:28 PM):  k
david (21:21:29 PM):  yeah, thats good
melany (21:21:37 PM):  great
lynn (21:22:06 PM):  at least it's not 5 percent
melany (21:22:55 PM):  im glad we could finally make an agreement :)
lynn (21:23:05 PM):  yea, this was a wierd one
melany (21:23:18 PM):  i agree
meg (21:23:53 PM):  yeah!
lynn (21:24:16 PM):  la la la la la
lynn (21:24:20 PM):  ......
david (21:24:23 PM):  yeah, not much other info to go on
david (21:24:28 PM):  for such important decisions
melany (21:24:29 PM):  hahah just waiting for the survey i guess
meg (21:24:59 PM):  :)
lynn (21:25:22 PM):  where is ?
moderator (21:25:54 PM):  There's my cue .. : = )

george (8:16:34 PM):  hi
john (8:17:00 PM):  hi
mara (8:17:08 PM):  hey everyone
mara (8:17:12 PM):  how goes it?
george (8:17:46 PM):  pretty good...did you see the topic for tonight?
mara (8:18:01 PM):  yes....
mara (8:18:12 PM):  ugh! i really have no opinion at all ha
nick (8:18:26 PM):  ola
amy  (8:18:35 PM):  Good evening!
mara (8:18:40 PM):  we are all going to end on a good foot for our last conversation together!
mara (8:19:23 PM):  i think i might cry,... we might never have contact with eachother again you know!?
george (8:19:50 PM):  :( :( :(
meg (8:20:14 PM):  hi everyone
amy  (8:20:20 PM):  it has been interesting
mara (8:20:24 PM):  hey meg
john (8:20:41 PM):  haha  mara
meg (8:20:44 PM):  tonight's subject looks exciting
mara (8:20:51 PM):  :D
meg (8:21:54 PM):  who else thinks that cheyney is ridiculous?
mara (8:21:55 PM):  so everyone sleepin or what?
meg (8:21:59 PM):  because I really do
meg (8:22:16 PM):  I'm sleeping but trying to sleep-type lol
amy  (8:22:46 PM):  just going over those articles posted
amy  (8:22:56 PM):  pretty depressing if you dont mind me saying
george (8:23:04 PM):  torture is a a fact of life in war
nick (8:23:17 PM):  intersting that Fox News is against revealing the truth, isn't it?
amy  (8:23:18 PM):  its still depressing
george (8:23:53 PM):  M16s use ammo that isn't meant to kill...the bullets are intended to bounce around and wound
meg (8:23:56 PM):  agreed george,. but in the fact that the war was built on falsified information really tells us that maybe we shouldn't have gone in in the first place...
mara (8:24:11 PM):  my bf is in the armed forces so i find this topic difficult to discuss
amy  (8:25:09 PM):  i dont blame you mara
mara (8:25:10 PM):  people are trained for this and they will do anything they have to achieve the goals that they are set out to do
george (8:25:23 PM):  i think there's more than one way to discuss this topic...there's the politics and there's the practicality
amy  (8:25:25 PM):  tough for me too and i dont know anyone personally
mara (8:25:30 PM):  i think what george said 'torutre is a fact of life in war" couldnt be more true
john (8:25:40 PM):  so you should know lots about that , mara
meg (8:25:51 PM):  I have family in the marines too
mara (8:25:53 PM):  sure do
meg (8:26:13 PM):  the more we learn about the bush administration, the more the country is in a bad siutation
george (8:26:35 PM):  if i'm on patrol and i catch someone setting IEDs, torturing him could be saving my own life not to mention my friends'
mara (8:26:42 PM):  its like everyone my age.. my friends, are going off to some sort of military training so i know about 20 people right now.. most that have participated in this war
nick (8:26:56 PM):  The Bush Administration authorized torture to get false confessions to support their rational for war
nick (8:26:59 PM):  that was the only reason
john (8:27:02 PM):  so you can give some info to us i think
meg (8:27:09 PM):  honestly i really hare the bush administration
meg (8:27:12 PM):  *hate
nick (8:27:20 PM):  they wanted to prove an Al Queda-Iraq link that  never existed
mara (8:27:27 PM):  im a conservative!
meg (8:27:29 PM):  agreed nick
john (8:27:34 PM):  hate the war
mara (8:27:34 PM):  hate to admit it most of the time... but
meg (8:27:46 PM):  i'm a liberal
meg (8:27:48 PM):  lol
george (8:28:02 PM):  do you like ron paul, mara?
mara (8:28:19 PM):  i dont think anyone likes war, but its about supporting our country and we are fighing a war then we have to support that too
meg (8:28:20 PM):  i just don't think that there's a good reason to keep so much underwraps in this country, it's a democracy, not a dictatorship
meg (8:28:28 PM):  i support the troops
meg (8:28:32 PM):  i don't support the way
meg (8:28:34 PM):  *war
nick (8:28:56 PM):  that sounds like blindly supporting without asking questions
john (8:28:59 PM):  so war in order to peace?
mara (8:29:17 PM):  hes an old timer... i like the grassroots campiagning he aims for, but other than that... im indifferent about him
amy  (8:29:38 PM):  who mara/
amy  (8:29:41 PM):  ?
mara (8:29:47 PM):  rom paul
john (8:29:47 PM):  who
meg (8:29:48 PM):  war in order for peace but under complete lies
mara (8:29:49 PM):  ron*
amy  (8:29:52 PM):  oh
meg (8:29:56 PM):  falsified information
mara (8:29:56 PM):  george asked me about him
meg (8:30:11 PM):  bush was setting up links that didn't exist
john (8:30:23 PM):  ok
mara (8:30:28 PM):  hey, if we knew everything that went on in this country we would have a crazy nation
george (8:30:39 PM):  i think ron paul is what the majority of americans are looking for, but don't realize it
mara (8:30:39 PM):  people couldnt handle it
amy  (8:30:45 PM):  i believe our govt primarily has their citizens best interest in mind......but the way to achieve this best interest varies in the eye of the beholder/ politicians in charge
michelle (8:30:55 PM):  did bush do that intentionally?
mara (8:30:59 PM):  he ran for president before right, george/
mara (8:31:00 PM):  ?
meg (8:31:06 PM):  i think that obama is the thing that our country is looking for
mara (8:31:19 PM):  ohhh no
mara (8:31:26 PM):  OBAMA... BOO haha
mara (8:31:34 PM):  im a haaattteeerrrr sorry
meg (8:31:34 PM):  really?
amy  (8:31:35 PM):  yes, obama seems closer to the people than to govt shenanigans
john (8:31:36 PM):  why
george (8:32:03 PM):  ron paul loses in the primaries
mara (8:32:05 PM):  well its too early to tell yet, but i dont think he will succeed to do what the people think
meg (8:32:06 PM):  its alright, i respect your opinion, but i honestly feel that he's probably the best thing that could have happened
michelle (8:32:30 PM):  so far obama seems doing well
george (8:32:32 PM):  obama is not doing a good job with economy :(
amy  (8:32:38 PM):  if this attitude of "losing" before trying in on peoples minds, then how the heck are we supposed to succeed???
meg (8:32:42 PM):  he's got a long way to go to repair the nation that bush-cheyney messed up
mara (8:32:47 PM):  well.. one thing i question is the fact that he was elected by the majority but votes minority!
meg (8:32:50 PM):  He can't fix it in a few months
nick (8:32:51 PM):  none of the memos about torture would have been revealed if Obama hadn't been elected
amy  (8:32:56 PM):  attitude is everything and that energy is contacgious!
amy  (8:33:18 PM):  i agree nick
meg (8:33:29 PM):  obama at least has a good attitude and a good public image
amy  (8:33:32 PM):  it is good to have it come out-  both sides
nick (8:33:38 PM):  so we would never have known the truth
mara (8:33:47 PM):  there are ways to find this information.. it doesnt have to be popular news to figure it out
meg (8:33:48 PM):  i agree too nick
george (8:34:15 PM):  propping up AIG, BoA, Fanny, Freddie, etc. is a bad move...the infrastructure and green projects are funded on non-existant funds
nick (8:34:15 PM):  what way would you suggest if the government won't release the information?
meg (8:34:18 PM):  yeah but the bush administration trtied to keep it underwraps- even at the expense of their own CIA agents
john (8:34:29 PM):  agree nick
meg (8:34:38 PM):  "CIA officer, Valerie Plame Wilson, whose identity was betrayed by senior officials in the George W. Bush administration."
george (8:34:55 PM):  btw, didn't obama promise to bring the troops home immediately?
mara (8:35:03 PM):  do what the journalists do... fish it out
meg (8:35:08 PM):  he can't di that george
meg (8:35:16 PM):  do*
nick (8:35:20 PM):  no i don't think he ever made that promise, george - he never said "immediately"
george (8:35:22 PM):  it got pushed back to 16 months, then 23 months...he's sending more troops to afghanistan
meg (8:35:33 PM):  he said he had a plan to try to get them out
meg (8:35:41 PM):  but that what it is
meg (8:35:42 PM):  a plan
george (8:35:47 PM):  he did promise it tho!
meg (8:35:49 PM):  plans change
amy  (8:35:57 PM):  yes, he has more of the idea to pull them out than McCain had \
nick (8:36:00 PM):  Bush ignored Afghanistant where the real problems are, so now Obama has to handle it
meg (8:36:02 PM):  he wanted to but the party was really really against it
george (8:36:03 PM):  he said he'd begin drawing down immediately
mara (8:36:04 PM):  i personally think that history repeats itself  and all the wars share the commonality of violence and distruction
john (8:36:22 PM):  yes amy 
nick (8:36:29 PM):  so "begin drawing down" is not "withdraw all"
amy  (8:36:35 PM):  i think there are plans/ dates of some troops coming home
mara (8:36:37 PM):  yeah and my bf is being deployed in august... just in time for our wedding that was planned for september! :(
nick (8:36:51 PM):  sorry mara
george (8:36:52 PM):  we should leave afghanistan too imo!
meg (8:36:58 PM):  im sorry he's leaving too
mara (8:37:09 PM):  thanks, i appreciate that
john (8:37:13 PM):  congratulation mara
meg (8:37:19 PM):  i don't think we can leave afghanistan while bin laden is still out there
mara (8:37:24 PM):  life goes on... i just hope that he comes back
meg (8:37:30 PM):  it's an affront to the attacks from 9/11
meg (8:37:36 PM):  he'll come back
meg (8:37:54 PM):  it'll just be hard waiting. but you can do it
mara (8:38:17 PM):  i think it sucks that another president had to get involved with this.. i think if bush was still in the administration he would have had plans to get us out sooner or later
george (8:38:27 PM):  hold on i'll get you some stuff
nick (8:38:29 PM):  so what happened to Bush getting Bin Laden?
meg (8:38:31 PM):  i don't think that
mara (8:38:42 PM):  he did... lol
mara (8:38:49 PM):  he has an evil twin :/
meg (8:39:08 PM):  Hussein was NOT linked to al queda
meg (8:39:11 PM):  at all
nick (8:39:19 PM):  true
john (8:39:26 PM):  yes
meg (8:39:30 PM):  he wasn't involved with the 9/11 attacks
nick (8:39:37 PM):  although Fox News viewers stil think he was
meg (8:39:42 PM):  he didn't even HAVE WMD's
michelle (8:39:43 PM):  right, but to finish the job not done by the first Bush
meg (8:39:49 PM):  fox news is really right wing
john (8:40:02 PM):  you mean bush meg?
george (8:40:28 PM):  btw, do you guys support torturing bin laden?
michelle (8:40:38 PM):  i don't quite get it, what is the really reason going to Iraq?
meg (8:40:41 PM):  no i mean that saddam hussein- iraq - didn't possess the wmd's that were claimed to be the reason for going to war in the first place
mara (8:40:58 PM):  good question george..
michelle (8:40:59 PM):  oh, yeah, if we can get him, george.
meg (8:41:01 PM):  i don't think he should be tortured, but put to trial and executed
nick (8:41:04 PM):  george, he should be interrogated first
mara (8:41:14 PM):  no trial.. just kill him
mara (8:41:27 PM):  thats a little harsh
amy  (8:41:39 PM):  but there might be others out there like him- under him
mara (8:41:47 PM):  but its like hitler, why waste the time we all know hes not all hes made out to be
amy  (8:41:55 PM):  interrigation first for sure, no torture at all
george (8:42:28 PM):  btw, do you guys know about bin laden's history?
nick (8:42:40 PM):  And Bin Laden is completely different from these low-level people - some of whom were completely innocent - that got sent to Guantanamo and tortured
john (8:42:47 PM):  it is interesting, george
meg (8:42:48 PM):  the ways of torture that were leaked are really ridiculous too
george (8:42:54 PM):  i think his alias is Tim Osmond
nick (8:43:05 PM):  !
george (8:43:12 PM):  bin laden is our boy!
john (8:43:24 PM):  hehe
mara (8:43:34 PM):  lol
george (8:43:38 PM):  congrats to the CIA for their fine bin laden product line
meg (8:43:44 PM):  they would put people with bug phobias in a box blindfolded with a caterpillar and told it was a scorpion
mara (8:43:48 PM):  i see the seriousness of what you are saying
meg (8:44:03 PM):  one man had a heart attack in there and died because of it
meg (8:44:06 PM):  that's just wrong
nick (8:44:18 PM):  he's related to the saudi royal family, after all
meg (8:44:37 PM):  there's a point at which interrogation becomes torture and is just inhumane
mara (8:44:40 PM):  so what can we do to change the image of our culture that is being portrayed by the media?
george (8:44:57 PM):  we trained bin laden to fight the russians in afghanistan
meg (8:45:07 PM):  i knew that george
john (8:45:16 PM):  good point mara
nick (8:45:16 PM):  yes, that really came back to haunt us
meg (8:45:41 PM):  we were fighting the soviets
george (8:45:44 PM):  so one has to wonder what information you'd get from him if you tortured him
meg (8:46:05 PM):  thats why the nuclear arms proliferation is such a big deal
george (8:46:10 PM):  i don't think he'll ever be captured alive
george (8:46:28 PM):  (hyperlink)
john (8:46:34 PM):  what useful info to get
george (8:46:38 PM):  good article on torture
meg (8:46:45 PM):  so many weapons are around that part of the world because of the collapse of the soviet union
john (8:47:12 PM):  i hate war
meg (8:47:22 PM):  no one likes war
amy  (8:47:56 PM):  never ending cycle
amy  (8:48:19 PM):  almost pointless to debate- however, important to know the issues to speak out to your govt
john (8:48:41 PM):  sure
meg (8:48:57 PM):  agreed amy 
amy  (8:49:04 PM):  if we as civilians go out and torture someone, we are thrown in a cell with the key tossed away
meg (8:49:17 PM):  agreed again
george (8:49:21 PM):  torture is one of those things that is understood to go on but never officially endorsed at the top political levels
amy  (8:49:21 PM):  why is someone in an authority position any different
john (8:49:29 PM):  sure
amy  (8:49:35 PM):  sad
meg (8:49:47 PM):  the whole point of the torture was to make fake links to the iraq war
meg (8:50:01 PM):  waterboarding is inhumane
amy  (8:50:06 PM):  why spend so much energy on s.th like that
meg (8:50:09 PM):  it's just wrong
mara (8:50:15 PM):  what about people who torture themselves... thats my question
george (8:50:17 PM):  torture also doesn't work with individuals i think...you have to cross reference information
amy  (8:50:27 PM):  who cares  lol
mara (8:50:30 PM):  suicide bombers and such.. how do we view them/
mara (8:50:32 PM):  lol
amy  (8:50:33 PM):  they can torture themselves if they want
meg (8:50:38 PM):  that'
george (8:50:40 PM):  one guy breaks and spits names of 10 guys, you then have to go torture them and see if the information is consistent
meg (8:50:43 PM):  that's not torture
amy  (8:50:43 PM):  ahh that is different
meg (8:50:49 PM):  it's just death
john (8:50:49 PM):  agree to george
mara (8:50:56 PM):  thats like saying woman can be objectified if they want
meg (8:51:05 PM):  i disagree george
mara (8:51:06 PM):  WHOA... my screen just went nuts
mara (8:51:13 PM):  why does this always happen to me?
meg (8:51:17 PM):  that's not waht it's like saying
meg (8:51:24 PM):  i completely disagree
nick (8:51:26 PM):  george, i think in some situations interrogation of known enemeies (NOT random people turneed in for bounty) can produce useful information, yes
meg (8:51:51 PM):  the whole point of suicide bombing is kill as many people as possible- does that make it right? no
john (8:51:51 PM):  my screen is flashing
george (8:52:06 PM):  link
meg (8:52:10 PM):  me too
mara (8:52:17 PM):  sorry got booted..
george (8:52:31 PM):  there's a good video to watch...that has a lot of information about obama you should know
amy  (8:52:40 PM):  no suicide bombing is not right-  it is not mentally stable
mara (8:52:41 PM):  haha george
john (8:53:02 PM):  i will see that
amy  (8:53:12 PM):  suicide bombing is not right
mara (8:53:21 PM):  its not amy ?
mara (8:53:24 PM):  are you sure.. haha
meg (8:53:26 PM):  george this thing that you sent is some what offensive
mara (8:53:37 PM):  lmao
george (8:53:43 PM):  that's just how counter intelligence warfare works
mara (8:53:44 PM):  how did i know that was coming
nick (8:54:16 PM):  wow, george, right win propaganda... huh
meg (8:54:19 PM):  you realize that the nation was built for economic gains?!
meg (8:54:26 PM):  for only a portion of the population!
nick (8:54:49 PM):  where was all this outrage while Bush spent TRILLIONS on invading Iraq?
meg (8:54:59 PM):  AGREED nick
george (8:55:11 PM):  his language is crude, yes, but he doesn't beat around the bush!
meg (8:55:12 PM):  We wonder where the economy went?
meg (8:55:18 PM):  look at how well Iraq is doing
amy  (8:55:19 PM):  its fine to question govt and your president but if there is nothing that he has done to put you in jeopardy there is not reason to push him down saying he is wrong about everything0 even when it hasnt happened yet
john (8:55:25 PM):  good points meg
meg (8:55:37 PM):  it'
meg (8:55:38 PM):  s
meg (8:55:42 PM):  not just the langauge
george (8:55:50 PM):  ron paul supporters didn't want him to go into iraq!
meg (8:56:08 PM):  Ron paul is TOO conservatice
meg (8:56:10 PM):  *v
nick (8:56:22 PM):  george, so why weren't they calling him names over spending trillions? Where was the outrage?
meg (8:56:48 PM):  And why was Clinton impeached for a B-J and Bush NOT for war crimes?!
meg (8:56:58 PM):  He went AGAINST the geneva convention
meg (8:57:02 PM):  Which we signed!
mara (8:57:02 PM):  what!?
mara (8:57:19 PM):  this is outrage
mara (8:57:24 PM):  thanks alot  ! haha
george (8:57:33 PM):  ok, well why isn't obama prosecuting them?
john (8:57:38 PM):  hah
meg (8:57:49 PM):  I think that it will get there
george (8:57:51 PM):  obama should be prosecuting the torturers!
mara (8:58:02 PM):  the point isnt right wing/left wing... we should all learn how to get along thats the major crime here
meg (8:58:11 PM):  For obeying their supervisors?!
george (8:58:15 PM):  he's not going to, he's stated publically
mara (8:58:19 PM):  then half this nation would be prosecuted
nick (8:58:24 PM):  george, why do you think Republicans are so against prosecuting torture?
mara (8:58:51 PM):  because they are the ones giving commands
george (8:59:02 PM):  here's my opinion...torture should not be public policy obviously
mara (8:59:05 PM):  thats like saying that Moses doesn't follow the ten commandments
george (8:59:19 PM):  so we should prosecute cases that have been brought to the public
nick (8:59:24 PM):  george, Republicans are against any prosecutions - just watch Fox
george (8:59:36 PM):  otherwise, don't go to war if you don't want torture
mara (8:59:44 PM):  no not fox... CSPAN
mara (9:00:13 PM):  some people dont have that option, but it is a price you pay for living in this country
mara (9:00:20 PM):  we are defending our power
mara (9:00:28 PM):  its not the easiest thing in the world to do
george (9:01:10 PM):  mara, unfortunately our power may be gone already :/  just look at social security
john (9:01:13 PM):  agree to mara
mara (9:01:15 PM):  hushh.. ***
mara (9:01:50 PM):  well im not too worried about my security at this point I will hopefully have financial gains that will cover my ass till i die
george (9:01:52 PM):  obama just needs to implement his universal health care with our chinese credit card!
mara (9:02:01 PM):  LMAO
mara (9:02:08 PM):  not a good idea! we are no CANADA
george (9:02:13 PM):  oh wait, chinese purchases of treasury bonds is dropping...
mara (9:02:35 PM):  i think everyone is done with this conversation
george (9:03:02 PM):  i think it's just the politics of torture are too far reaching
mara (9:03:09 PM):  Does it undermine the United States image in the world when such stories are presented in the media?
amy  (9:03:41 PM):  US is definitely seen in a poor light right now
nick (9:03:46 PM):  it undermines us when it's authorized - pictures are just proof
mara (9:03:52 PM):  it looks like yes becuase a few of u here tonight are bad mouthing this country and the battle we fight because of this new media coverage
george (9:03:54 PM):  nobody likes a torturer, mara!
mara (9:04:09 PM):  i love one actually
nick (9:04:10 PM):  oh i see, now it comes out
meg (9:04:33 PM):  no one is bad mouthing the country
mara (9:04:35 PM):  i meant us* not u BTW
meg (9:04:49 PM):  i am completely in support with the US
meg (9:04:57 PM):  not the former administration!
mara (9:05:06 PM):  by talking smack about the political heads of this country we are bad mouthing it
meg (9:05:10 PM):  everyone has a right to their opinion
mara (9:05:25 PM):  thats my point meg... the former administration was this country
mara (9:05:32 PM):  and now obama is this country
john (9:05:36 PM):  agree to meg
meg (9:05:37 PM):  i did NOT vote for bush
meg (9:05:57 PM):  so why should i be in complete agreement with his policies?
mara (9:05:57 PM):  if that was really true than we would be much more democratic than we play on
meg (9:06:04 PM):  I don't need to agree with him
john (9:06:13 PM):  now Obama is this country
meg (9:06:25 PM):  no one person is the country
meg (9:06:30 PM):  this is a LARGE
meg (9:06:31 PM):  nation
john (9:06:47 PM):  sure
meg (9:07:01 PM):  not everyone has to agree with the political heads who were voted for by the majority
meg (9:07:21 PM):  isn't it american to decide about the politics for yourself?
george (9:07:25 PM):  btw, are there levels of torture?
mara (9:07:31 PM):  when one person has the power to being us to war.. i think they are our country! after all we allow him to speak on behalf of us at every convention, political rally, every nation, country, third world he visits
meg (9:07:34 PM):  rather than blindly follwing the leaders?
john (9:07:40 PM):  hehe
george (9:07:59 PM):  is playing metallica to muslims equivalent to burning a koran in front of them and in turn equivalent to electrocution?
nick (9:08:01 PM):  mara, the preident does not have the power to bring us to wat - that's the Congress
nick (9:08:07 PM):  *president
nick (9:08:15 PM):  *war
nick (9:08:17 PM):  ugh
mara (9:08:30 PM):  right.. but didnt bush overstep that privilege?
meg (9:08:33 PM):  the prez can only go to war for 90 days w.o congress
meg (9:08:44 PM):  yes he did
george (9:08:54 PM):  the war was against the constitution
john (9:08:55 PM):  right
mara (9:08:55 PM):  so he had the power to bring us to war... thats all i was saying
meg (9:09:04 PM):  he made the executive branch wayyyy too powerful
mara (9:09:11 PM):  i know the check and balances.. but obv they were not working all that well
john (9:09:13 PM):  hehe
mara (9:09:51 PM):  george what are you babbling about anyway
mara (9:10:03 PM):  and where did the amy go?
amy  (9:10:14 PM):  i'm here-
george (9:10:17 PM):  US congress never declared war in Iraq
amy  (9:10:23 PM):  hehe
meg (9:10:25 PM):  metalica is not the equivalent of burning the koran
michelle (9:10:31 PM):  still here. hehe
john (9:10:40 PM):  never?
nick (9:10:49 PM):  what's all this giggling about? :)
amy  (9:10:50 PM):  so michelle, what shall we talk about?
george (9:10:52 PM):  so meg, is there an acceptable level of torture?
meg (9:10:59 PM):  religious persecution is not that funny
amy  (9:11:14 PM):  um no its not funny at all
amy  (9:11:22 PM):  with ya meg
meg (9:11:29 PM):  playing metailca is not TORTURE
meg (9:11:32 PM):  and no
meg (9:11:33 PM):  there isn't
john (9:11:42 PM):  it is not funny at all
michelle (9:11:55 PM):  then how to define torture
mara (9:11:56 PM):  really religion?
mara (9:11:59 PM):  i cant do that...
mara (9:12:00 PM):  sorry
amy  (9:12:08 PM):  my bf is from bosnia- and was allowed in this country for freedom
george (9:12:09 PM):  well, solitary confinement can be considered torture
amy  (9:12:15 PM):  i cant say something too bad about where we live and breathe
nick (9:12:20 PM):  torture is clearly defined by the Geneva Conventions - which the Bush Administration ignored
meg (9:12:32 PM):  what?
george (9:12:38 PM):  and we do that quite a bit with prisoners even with our own American prisoners
meg (9:12:42 PM):  being muslim isn't religios?
amy  (9:12:50 PM):  but i do know that torture is why many people i know came here to this wonderful country
amy  (9:13:14 PM):  torture has no place at the hands of real Americans
mara (9:13:26 PM):  all countries torture...
nick (9:13:30 PM):  it's interesting to me that opposing policies of an administration is equated to saying bad things about the country
amy  (9:13:54 PM):  then why dont we tell people to stay in their own countries so they can continue to be tortured
mara (9:14:00 PM):  im getting angry sorry, but take it gentle im trying not to be to pushy... but constitues a real american?
amy  (9:14:12 PM):  but yes, i understand torture exists
meg (9:14:15 PM):  dictionary.com- 1. 	the act of inflicting excruciating pain, as punishment or revenge, as a means of getting a confession or information, or for sheer cruelty.2. 	a method of inflicting such pain.3. 	Often, tortures. the pain or suffering caused or undergone.4. 	extreme anguish of body or mind; agony.5. 	a cause of severe pain or anguish.
amy  (9:14:39 PM):  an american is someone with an open mind that is willing to hear many sides of issues
amy  (9:14:51 PM):  a decision is not made by one, but by many
george (9:14:52 PM):  Article 11. For the purposes of this Convention, the term "torture" means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.
john (9:14:54 PM):  thanks,meg
meg (9:15:09 PM):  n/p
nick (9:15:35 PM):  thank you george
george (9:15:40 PM):  there's the United Nations Convention definition
amy  (9:15:41 PM):  michelle...what do you think....
meg (9:15:46 PM):  yeah thanks george
amy  (9:15:47 PM):  jamie...what do you think......
amy  (9:15:59 PM):  john......
mara (9:16:00 PM):  that covers all grounds
john (9:16:15 PM):  yes
meg (9:16:25 PM):  so isn't torture against international law then?
mara (9:16:34 PM):  so why are we even debating this issue... torture happened and it will continue to happen as long as we need information that is not being provided to us
meg (9:16:37 PM):  and the bush administration can be tried for breaking those laws
john (9:16:50 PM):  good question,meg
george (9:17:04 PM):  they should be tried...that's not our public policy to torture
meg (9:17:06 PM):  but it SHOULDN"T happen!
george (9:17:13 PM):  at least in the public's eye
meg (9:17:15 PM):  that's the whole point
meg (9:17:33 PM):  its not just the public eye
amy  (9:17:36 PM):  yes meg, i agree-  never ending cycle because most humans will remain closedminded without thinking outside their comfort levels
mara (9:17:40 PM):  right george, but how will they be stopped?
nick (9:17:41 PM):  mara, interrogation and torture are two different things
meg (9:17:42 PM):  it's in our new administration's eyes too
john (9:17:45 PM):  agree to meg
mara (9:18:04 PM):  it seems as though they come hand in hand nick
george (9:18:20 PM):  they need to be prosecuted...that's in obama's hands
meg (9:18:27 PM):  there's a difference between interrogation and torture
mara (9:18:37 PM):  duh
george (9:18:38 PM):  but it's not going to happen...obama is not as big a change as you'd expect
meg (9:18:44 PM):  interrogation doesn't involve inflicting serious bodily harm
john (9:18:47 PM):  yes
mara (9:18:51 PM):  but im saying...  right now you cant get one without the other
john (9:19:02 PM):  isn't he?
meg (9:19:04 PM):  yes you can~
mara (9:19:09 PM):  NO!!! HES NOT
mara (9:19:12 PM):  but im a hater
nick (9:19:23 PM):  I completely disagree mara - they are always seperate
meg (9:19:34 PM):  obama is openly trying to change the problems
mara (9:19:48 PM):  always? always is a tough word
amy  (9:19:53 PM):  why are we still knocking obama?
meg (9:20:04 PM):  always is true though
john (9:20:06 PM):  haha
amy  (9:20:08 PM):  did he vote to torture people or something?
nick (9:20:23 PM):  Bush authorized tortute - that's why it was done - if he didn't authorize it, the interrogators wouldn't have done it
john (9:20:28 PM):  i don;t think so
meg (9:20:36 PM):  agreed nick
george (9:20:39 PM):  changing the problems involves prosecuting people who broke the law
amy  (9:20:39 PM):  ahha
john (9:20:46 PM):  sure
meg (9:20:52 PM):  agreed george
mara (9:20:53 PM):  right nick, so who should be on trial... BUSH?
mara (9:20:54 PM):  i think so
amy  (9:21:01 PM):  nicely said
meg (9:21:05 PM):  then maybe we should be waterboarding cheyney
george (9:21:07 PM):  obama is implicitly endorsing the last administration by not prosecuting
amy  (9:21:17 PM):  lol
amy  (9:21:19 PM):  sure
amy  (9:21:29 PM):  no----bc we are AGAINST torture
nick (9:21:29 PM):  i doubt it will ever happen - i'd like to start with Bybee
mara (9:21:32 PM):  def,.
meg (9:21:32 PM):  he is not
amy  (9:21:35 PM):  we can interrogate him maybe  lol
meg (9:21:48 PM):  he's against it and its up to the UN to prosecute them
amy  (9:21:51 PM):  WE
amy  (9:21:56 PM):  the people
meg (9:22:03 PM):  it international law
john (9:22:09 PM):  maybe
meg (9:22:10 PM):  not up to the US
george (9:22:12 PM):  he'd have a heart attack :o
mara (9:22:19 PM):  got booted again
meg (9:22:46 PM):  not a problem with me
meg (9:22:53 PM):  (him having a heart attack)
john (9:22:57 PM):  sure it is
john (9:23:04 PM):  agree to meg
mara (9:23:12 PM):  but it was a problem when the guy had a heart attack because he was afraid of bugs?
mara (9:23:18 PM):  weird how that works
nick (9:23:21 PM):  There are already other countries who are investigating the Bush administration for war crimes - Spain
meg (9:23:45 PM):  i was being sarcastic
george (9:23:52 PM):  Where in the territory of a Party to the conflict, the latter is satisfied that an individual protected person is definitely suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State, such individual person shall not be entitled to claim such rights and privileges under the present Convention [ie GCIV] as would ... be prejudicial to the security of such State ... In each case, such persons shall nevertheless be treated with humanity (GCIV Article 5)
john (9:23:54 PM):  Spain?
george (9:24:04 PM):  an interesting exception in the geneva convention
nick (9:24:23 PM):  Yes, Spain is investigating
meg (9:24:47 PM):  he wasn't just afraid of bugs mara
meg (9:24:51 PM):  he had a phobia
meg (9:24:54 PM):  that's not just fear
john (9:25:09 PM):  yes
nick (9:25:09 PM):  Spain weighs torture inquiry for 6 former Bush officials - link
john (9:25:26 PM):  thanks nick
george (9:25:37 PM):  they'll never be able to prosecute, nick, without approval from the US govt.
nick (9:25:55 PM):  "The case was sent to the prosecutor's office for review by Baltasar Garzon, the crusading investigative judge who ordered the arrest of the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet."  OUCH
george (9:25:58 PM):  prosecute or try
nick (9:26:05 PM):  Pinochet and Bush!
meg (9:26:36 PM):  hahaha nick
john (9:27:19 PM):  haha
nick (9:27:49 PM):  They can be arrested if they go to Spain
meg (9:27:54 PM):  the torture is illegal- period
meg (9:28:01 PM):  i hope they do
nick (9:28:20 PM):  "The 98-page complaint, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, is based on the Geneva Conventions and the 1984 Convention Against Torture, which is binding on 145 countries, including Spain and the United States. Countries that are party to the torture convention are obliged to investigate torture cases, especially when a citizen has been abused."
george (9:28:57 PM):  yea, there's a whole slew of legal mumbo jumbo
george (9:29:15 PM):  they are "enemy combatants"
mara (9:29:19 PM):  goodness
meg (9:29:26 PM):  its good that someone's investigating it
john (9:29:52 PM):  yes, meg
meg (9:30:38 PM):  does anyone feel like the us image is changing for the positive?
nick (9:30:46 PM):  Yes!
meg (9:30:52 PM):  yayyy
john (9:30:58 PM):  agree
george (9:31:11 PM):  i think that's a tough question to answer
nick (9:31:21 PM):  I'm so glad that Obama understands the concept of diplomacy
meg (9:31:21 PM):  the whole thing is that the world as a whole is feeling better about the country
meg (9:31:24 PM):  really george?
george (9:31:28 PM):  remember much of the world blames us for the global economic crisis
amy  (9:31:32 PM):  changing since when- how much time
meg (9:31:46 PM):  since obama's election
amy  (9:32:01 PM):  oh absolutely yes i do
george (9:32:02 PM):  yes, america and american banks
meg (9:32:26 PM):  but i think it's gotten better with obama
meg (9:32:41 PM):  people can't expect an immediate change with the economic crisis
amy  (9:32:45 PM):  people are going to have to learn how to spend what they can afford-  that is something everyonene hasgotten awawy from
john (9:32:49 PM):  i think so, meg
meg (9:32:55 PM):  the problems with the economics started in the 70s
george (9:32:58 PM):  oh there's no doubt obama has more charisma than bush, but as for how they feel about the US?  i dunno.
meg (9:32:59 PM):  with the breton woods
amy  (9:33:05 PM):  with credit cards!
mara (9:33:21 PM):  changing for who?
mara (9:33:35 PM):  not everyone... i can say that much
john (9:33:37 PM):  hehe
meg (9:33:44 PM):  really?
meg (9:34:00 PM):  i think that the world opinion is a lot better with obama as our president
george (9:34:05 PM):  yes, meg has a good point!
meg (9:34:21 PM):  any of you guys see russell brand at the MTV awards?
amy  (9:34:22 PM):  it is a fresh start-  may have nee positive with anyone other than Bush
amy  (9:34:29 PM):  * been positive
john (9:34:31 PM):  from 70s?
meg (9:34:46 PM):  him pleading to the american public to elect obama
meg (9:34:58 PM):  a lot of people were offended
meg (9:35:07 PM):  but i thought it was actually pretty realistic
meg (9:35:27 PM):  he called bush a retarded cowboy
amy  (9:35:44 PM):  insensitive
john (9:35:44 PM):  hahha,meg
amy  (9:35:52 PM):  what an insult to some people who have challenges!
mara (9:36:01 PM):  i love cowboys
meg (9:36:04 PM):  lol
nick (9:36:09 PM):  yeah, i feel bad for cowboys
nick (9:36:21 PM):  being compared to Bush!
meg (9:36:21 PM):  agreed nick
john (9:36:33 PM):  i don't like
george (9:36:38 PM):  heh...that reminds me of a youtube skit called retarded policeman
john (9:36:42 PM):  haha
john (9:37:08 PM):  what's that ,george
george (9:37:11 PM):  (youtube hyperlink)
john (9:37:26 PM):  thank you ,george
george (9:37:29 PM):  that's retarded policeman, john!
john (9:38:10 PM):  it is interesting, haha
meg (9:38:30 PM):  i saw his comedy central thing after the vma's and it was even better
meg (9:39:05 PM):  seeing how other people view the us is really interesting
john (9:39:31 PM):  maybe
meg (9:39:36 PM):  i have family in wales and they really worried about the election
mara (9:40:23 PM):  whales!
mara (9:40:24 PM):  lol

cinthia (10:03:25 AM):  wat do u mean by instinct?
eva (10:03:38 AM):  as in don't think about weighing pros and cons
eva (10:03:48 AM):  just your initial reaction to the resumes and who you think you would want to hire
cinthia (10:05:45 AM):  hold on i gotta read it
eva (10:05:52 AM):  np it's long :-)
cinthia (10:07:30 AM):  what does "in kind wage" mean
eva (10:07:43 AM):  it means that instead of money, you trade your services
eva (10:07:50 AM):  for something similar
eva (10:08:02 AM):  so, you babysit someone's kid in exchange for them babysitting your dog
cinthia (10:08:30 AM):  haha gotcha

tony (10:13:42 AM):  yea
cinthia (10:13:47 AM):  the only experience ryan really has is a lifeguard
caroline (10:13:54 AM):  i actually like sandra over penny
eva (10:14:02 AM):  but Sandra's camp counselor experience is with 5-10 year olds
eva (10:14:09 AM):  does that change anything or not matter?
rebecca (10:14:21 AM):  and pennys is with dogs..
cinthia (10:14:32 AM):  thats true
caroline (10:14:32 AM):  yes but she was also involved in outreach programs, that could have been w/ older kids
cinthia (10:14:42 AM):  i like sandra
caroline (10:14:43 AM):  (sandra)
eva (10:15:28 AM):  so..rebecca, julie vs cinthia and caroline
rebecca (10:15:40 AM):  no id go with sandra
rebecca (10:15:47 AM):  i hadnt made it that far yet lol
eva (10:15:57 AM):  what made you change your mind?
rebecca (10:16:22 AM):  sandra was working with actual organizations while penny was babysitting and pet sitting on her own
eva (10:16:34 AM):  but what about Big Brothers/Big Sisters?
eva (10:16:41 AM):  That's a pretty presitgious group for Penny
rebecca (10:16:48 AM):  so sandra was definitely dealing with a larger group
eva (10:16:52 AM):  no
eva (10:16:55 AM):  Penny was the BB/BS
eva (10:17:00 AM):  Sandra doesn't have that
cinthia (10:17:19 AM):  big brother big sis works more with younger children too
rebecca (10:17:21 AM):  big brother big sister is one on one
rebecca (10:17:31 AM):  where camp is a group setting
eva (10:17:39 AM):  right...do RAs only work in group settings?
eva (10:17:45 AM):  or in both group and one-on-one
tony (10:17:52 AM):  both
rebecca (10:17:52 AM):  so do camp counselors
eva (10:17:53 AM):  think of your own RAs, if you had one
eva (10:18:01 AM):  and what you saw them for
rebecca (10:18:16 AM):  im just saying camp counselors have to multitask more
tony (10:18:19 AM):  i saw my RA like twice lol
julie (10:18:50 AM):  i think penny has more work experience and has also worked for longer periods of time showing consistency
caroline (10:18:51 AM):  that's a good point
eva (10:19:09 AM):  let's say the work experience didn't matter since they both have a lot of that
eva (10:19:13 AM):  would that change anything?
julie (10:19:51 AM):  well she a psych major, so she has an interest in people
julie (10:19:59 AM):  i guess which is good
tony (10:20:17 AM):  i dont think the major matters
julie (10:20:36 AM):  well if were not doing work experience
caroline (10:20:36 AM):  she might defend it and say it does
julie (10:20:39 AM):  idk
tony (10:20:50 AM):  u have to have people skillls
julie (10:20:57 AM):  yes
eva (10:21:28 AM):  hrmmm...they really have similar backgrounds
tony (10:21:33 AM):  i personally think anyone can be an RA as long as you can talk to people
caroline (10:21:39 AM):  maybe she is a osych major and has had all these involvements thus far because she is gearing towards working w/ these people in a profession setting eventually, maybe she has a genuine interest in this
eva (10:21:46 AM):  May 2012 grads, psych class, computer skills, tennis team
eva (10:21:55 AM):  they're both really one for one
julie (10:22:48 AM):  well penny has a better gpa
julie (10:22:51 AM):  means shes smart
cinthia (10:22:56 AM):  my friend was an RA n major didn't really have anything to do w
rebecca (10:23:10 AM):  sandra doesnt have her gpa on hers
julie (10:23:15 AM):  should shoe shes capable of handling school and a job
rebecca (10:23:17 AM):  which probably isnt good
julie (10:24:07 AM):  yes
caroline (10:24:10 AM):  hah
eva (10:25:58 AM):  any thoughts tony?
caroline (10:26:25 AM):  i also like the fact that penny has the literacy program involvement
caroline (10:26:35 AM):  although i'm not sure what that actually entails
eva (10:26:46 AM):  help people read/learn
julie (10:26:51 AM):  me too
tony (10:27:22 AM):  umm idk im still tryin to figure it out lol
cinthia (10:28:05 AM):  who is it between right now
eva (10:28:15 AM):  still Penny and Sandra
eva (10:28:26 AM):  people keep switching ^_^
eva (10:28:49 AM):  and tony is apparently undecided
tony (10:29:42 AM):  ill say penny or sandra
eva (10:30:24 AM):  i'm in the same boat
julie (10:30:57 AM):  same
julie (10:31:06 AM):  penny for now though
julie (10:31:40 AM):  luckily there is an hr to change my mind
cinthia (10:32:06 AM):  y u like penny over sandra?
cinthia (10:32:23 AM):  this thing wtont let me go back up n read
julie (10:32:47 AM):  she has a better gpa, more work experience, plenty of people skills
cinthia (10:35:06 AM):  gotcha
julie (10:35:23 AM):  i still like the fact that she did big brothers/ big sisters
caroline (10:35:29 AM):  i think the people skills are what's most important
julie (10:35:40 AM):  i agree
eva (10:36:05 AM):  i wish we had more info in that area
eva (10:36:18 AM):  the resumes seem...a bit short
caroline (10:36:39 AM):  yea in a normal resume there would likely be some more expansion on these important points
julie (10:36:50 AM):  i agree... i feel like the job descriptions werent really included
rebecca (10:36:58 AM):  yea
tony (10:38:19 AM):  im gunna throw this out there but what about evan or ryan
eva (10:38:25 AM):  hahaha
eva (10:38:41 AM):  sadly this is how most companies work :-(
eva (10:38:50 AM):  they sift through real quick and ignore a bunch :-(
tony (10:38:53 AM):  the most important thing about bein an RA is saftey and communication and they both show this
eva (10:38:57 AM):  but yeah...what about evan or ryan?
cinthia (10:39:29 AM):  evan seems qualified already worked for UA
caroline (10:39:52 AM):  where do you see communication from ryan?
tony (10:40:14 AM):  i just think all the others who hav experience being a camp counselor doesnt really matter cuz u are dealing with college kids not little kids
rebecca (10:40:16 AM):  only with the swimming classes
caroline (10:40:37 AM):  and where do you see safety w/ evan?
cinthia (10:40:59 AM):  cpr certified
tony (10:41:14 AM):  yea cpr
rebecca (10:41:14 AM):  i think thats ryan
caroline (10:41:15 AM):  oh ok i see it now
tony (10:41:21 AM):  its both
rebecca (10:41:23 AM):  ohh
rebecca (10:41:24 AM):  i see
julie (10:41:30 AM):  but he worked at a pool
cinthia (10:41:30 AM):  and first aid
tony (10:41:39 AM):  cuz u cant be a lifeguard without cpr training
julie (10:41:39 AM):  that really doesnt show people skills
tony (10:41:48 AM):  evan has people skills
cinthia (10:41:53 AM):  he was a cashier and worked at the bookstore
eva (10:41:55 AM):  well again...what did your RAs spend most of their time doing?
eva (10:42:03 AM):  interacting? or just handling emergencies?
cinthia (10:42:11 AM):  really... sitting in their rooms
eva (10:42:16 AM):  mine just handled emergencies
caroline (10:42:18 AM):  even has a really good gpa...might stand for something
cinthia (10:42:19 AM):  haha my best friend is an RA
julie (10:42:20 AM):  this is truw
eva (10:42:39 AM):  i think i only asked for help getting into my room
eva (10:42:45 AM):  or they saved some drunk student
rebecca (10:43:00 AM):  they also have to have programs and stuff right
cinthia (10:43:06 AM):  yeah... they honestly just help you get in your room, or get you in trouble for drugs n drinking
caroline (10:43:09 AM):  has anyone else had any other experiences with their RAs?
julie (10:43:10 AM):  well i think evan is better than ryan, he really has no experience.. any accomplishments he made were in hs
julie (10:43:38 AM):  nope mines about the same
tony (10:43:41 AM):  thats y im just saying they only need to be able to communicate and keep students safe
cinthia (10:44:03 AM):  they have to do like two programs a year... my friend chose (clover designs) for st pattys last year
caroline (10:44:05 AM):  yea i guess they're not really trying to be your best friend unless you luck out and get a really cool RA
rebecca (10:44:37 AM):  thats how they are... but thats not what theyre supposed to do
julie (10:44:41 AM):  i thought major doesnt matter
cinthia (10:44:59 AM):  instead of people skills... we need to be foucsing who is really going to stand their ground from what is in their resume
cinthia (10:45:06 AM):  they cant be pushovers
julie (10:45:26 AM):  mmhmm
tony (10:47:02 AM):  idk im kinda liking evan as well
tony (10:47:22 AM):  he fits two of the main criteria
tony (10:48:15 AM):  if u look at the responsibilities of the job he can fit all four
eva (10:48:19 AM):  so it's Sandra vs Penny, Evan vs Ryan
eva (10:48:31 AM):  we could this tournament style :-)
julie (10:48:32 AM):  i like that he has cpr training
eva (10:48:33 AM):  Final Four
julie (10:48:43 AM):  but he is a junior
julie (10:49:03 AM):  so he only serve 2 semesters as an RA
tony (10:49:22 AM):  thats all they ask for
julie (10:49:23 AM):  which is all you need, but still its better to start of earlier
rebecca (10:49:39 AM):  well you dont want too early either
julie (10:49:47 AM):  yes true
caroline (10:49:49 AM):  and for empire i think it's different
caroline (10:49:55 AM):  they expect those students to be older
rebecca (10:49:57 AM):  yea
caroline (10:50:07 AM):  you wouldn't want a sophmore in control for 21 year old people
julie (10:50:16 AM):  but i think they expect them to also have experience on other quads
tony (10:50:42 AM):  it doesnt say empire
rebecca (10:50:51 AM):  on his resume
caroline (10:51:00 AM):  i read it somwhere
rebecca (10:51:08 AM):  his objective i think
tony (10:51:22 AM):  not on evans
caroline (10:51:24 AM):  oh yea on ryan's thanks
caroline (10:51:34 AM):  i guess i thought i read it in the job description
tony (10:52:42 AM):  evan has the most experience to teach students about college life and hw to get used to it
rebecca (10:53:03 AM):  as in being a student the longest?
tony (10:53:11 AM):  yea
tony (10:53:14 AM):  most experience
eva (10:53:34 AM):  hrmm...I'm not really familiar with the dorms
caroline (10:53:41 AM):  sounds like he's very organized
eva (10:53:43 AM):  would someone mind explaining which dorm serves which area?
tony (10:53:46 AM):  and worked in the book store so he has interacted with other students and know more abut the school
caroline (10:54:18 AM):  i guess he has to be good too to have moved up ranks in the bookstore
caroline (10:54:31 AM):  what do you mean eva?
eva (10:54:46 AM):  oh, I don't know which year students live in which dorms
julie (10:54:55 AM):  hmm
tony (10:55:00 AM):  the dorm rooms dont really mater cuz u dont kno which one ur gunna be put into
tony (10:55:15 AM):  its doesnt say in the job description
eva (10:55:37 AM):  i only ask because it was brought up
tony (10:55:42 AM):  im gunna say evan for this one
cinthia (10:55:45 AM):  and its usually only fresh n soph that live in dorm
caroline (10:55:50 AM):  there are two freshman quads (dorms), two upperclassman, and two sets of upperclassman apartments (empire is one of them)
eva (10:55:54 AM):  ah thanks
eva (10:56:05 AM):  so an RA is most likely to deal with upperclassman
eva (10:56:10 AM):  based on stats
cinthia (10:56:16 AM):  no no lower classman
julie (10:56:19 AM):  kk
caroline (10:56:27 AM):  well it depends on where they are placed
eva (10:56:31 AM):  hehe I'm confuse now
tony (10:56:47 AM):  i wouldnt worry about the dorm situation
caroline (10:56:50 AM):  if they're placed in the dorms/quads they will likely deal with lower classman
eva (10:56:53 AM):  hey, mind if we take two quick polls?
tony (10:57:00 AM):  k
julie (10:57:02 AM):  ok
eva (10:57:06 AM):  first: Sandra or Penny?
julie (10:57:12 AM):  penny
caroline (10:57:14 AM):  if this guy is placed on empire (an apartment) like he is aspiring to he will deal with juniors and senniroes
rebecca (10:57:17 AM):  sandra
cinthia (10:57:54 AM):  sandra
tony (10:58:01 AM):  sandra
tony (10:58:07 AM):  but evan all the way
eva (10:58:14 AM):  hold on hold on :-)
caroline (10:58:16 AM):  sandra
eva (10:58:17 AM):  we'll get to Evan
eva (10:58:21 AM):  ok, Sandra for the first
eva (10:58:26 AM):  now, Evan or Ryan?
julie (10:58:33 AM):  evan
tony (10:58:39 AM):  evan
rebecca (10:58:45 AM):  evan
cinthia (10:58:57 AM):  evan
cinthia (10:59:15 AM):  evan vs. sandra
eva (10:59:17 AM):  yup!
caroline (10:59:20 AM):  evan
tony (10:59:21 AM):  evan
julie (10:59:31 AM):  evan
cinthia (10:59:55 AM):  evan
julie (11:00:00 AM):  i wish there was more information
eva (11:00:03 AM):  lol
eva (11:00:04 AM):  same
eva (11:00:13 AM):  sounds like Evan is our winner though
tony (11:01:11 AM):  yea
rebecca (11:01:47 AM):  still like 30 minutes...
eva (11:01:54 AM):  hahaha
eva (11:02:04 AM):  we were too efficient!
julie (11:03:10 AM):  oo yes
cinthia (11:05:04 AM):  well who do we not like
julie (11:05:08 AM):  great chat?
eva (11:05:14 AM):  i thought it was jade we didn't like
eva (11:05:17 AM):  oh well
eva (11:05:27 AM):  anyone got plans today?
rebecca (11:05:30 AM):  yea definitely
julie (11:05:34 AM):  sleep

melany (19:58:55 PM):  hi everyone
david (19:59:05 PM):  hello
ariel (19:59:39 PM):  hey
cinthia (20:00:40 PM):  hey guys
moderator (20:01:16 PM):  Hi guys. Please wait a few moments. I believe a couple other people may show up.

melany (20:03:53 PM):  ok
luke (20:04:05 PM):  kkkkkk
david (20:04:56 PM):  informal tally who's going to win the gold medal game, canada or U.S.? -basically, somebody said something about food or snacks that wasn't relevant to our assigment, so i'm doing the same thing -
david (20:05:21 PM):  okay , well - maybe we can get started
moderator (20:05:25 PM):  josh, could you please lead today?
moderator (20:05:26 PM):  You simply have to ensure that the discussion stays on track and that you (as a group) reach a consensus at the end.
josh (20:06:44 PM):  ok
moderator (20:06:58 PM):  Great, you may begin now, guys! :-)
cinthia (20:07:28 PM):  ight so who read it already?
josh (20:07:38 PM):  not me lol
cinthia (20:07:45 PM):  i wish i were a kid tryin it out
david (20:08:01 PM):  i read it, its about choosing a different tour of a learning facility, based on the criteria
david (20:08:14 PM):  one of the criteria however, is anything else we think is important
leah (20:09:30 PM):  hello everyone sorry for being late
cinthia (20:09:33 PM):  i personaly like the tour of the world one
david (20:09:54 PM):  i think wildlife and marine are pretty good for that age group - the science would proly have the best impact for job creation, but that's not really a criterion, unless it's the last - plus, a tour of a science museum might be too complex for 5th grade
cinthia (20:10:34 PM):  exactly
david (20:11:01 PM):  well, i'm not sure about exactly - but it's something to look into or consider, those points maybe
cinthia (20:11:49 PM):  lets start with the criterion of which will be easiest to learn
david (20:12:44 PM):  i think art history requires more perspective and more experience, it's tough for 5th graders
david (20:12:48 PM):  would be my guess
ariel (20:12:52 PM):  sorry about that this program closed and i had to restart it :(
josh (20:12:52 PM):  the virtual tour looks like it would be something fun and interesting for the kids so i think we should choose one that 5th graders dont really like to learn about and maybe the virtual tour will cause them to like that type of material more than they would have in a traditional class room
david (20:12:57 PM):  so maybe we can cross that off , sort of
leah (20:12:59 PM):  i think wildlife would be easiest to learn because it would captivate their interest alot
david (20:13:16 PM):  i think wildlife too
ariel (20:13:27 PM):  Yeah
david (20:13:29 PM):  it would really captivate their interest
leah (20:13:34 PM):  definitely
ariel (20:13:38 PM):  but i do have to say that the world tour sounds good to me as well
ariel (20:13:54 PM):  i mean isent the 5th grade the classic age where kids learn all 50 states and capitals?
david (20:14:10 PM):  yeah, but world tour is even better
cinthia (20:14:14 PM):  i agree
ariel (20:14:37 PM):  I mean i'll be honest i missed out on geography as a kid
david (20:14:38 PM):  yeah, thatd be pretty cool - if u want to do a virtual world tour right, it'd proly be cost prohibitive for most places
ariel (20:14:47 PM):  and now im in history class and i have no clue where anything is
leah (20:14:51 PM):  lol
cinthia (20:14:53 PM):  haha ariel
cinthia (20:14:55 PM):  me too
cinthia (20:15:08 PM):  but like especially with the new earthquake they could have it shown
cinthia (20:15:16 PM):  and raise awareness with that age group of how they can help
ariel (20:15:28 PM):  like it was so sad... they gave us an empty map and my group of 5 ppl came up with like 1/6th the countries and they were almost all wrong
leah (20:15:34 PM):  great point
david (20:15:34 PM):  one way to solve that is to look at a map, like google maps for example
josh (20:16:00 PM):  yea that does sound good
leah (20:16:54 PM):  and it gives them views of different important geographical places as well
david (20:17:31 PM):  yeah, the world tour would be good - it is interesting content
cinthia (20:17:42 PM):  generate interest in the countries potential for travel
josh (20:17:56 PM):  ok so which ones would we def not want to do?
ariel (20:17:57 PM):  yeah and i think that real life pictures of each place would also give them something to remember
david (20:18:04 PM):  yeah, showing some places in each area
leah (20:18:11 PM):  mhm
david (20:18:24 PM):  yeah, some real life videos and pictures would help bring to life
cinthia (20:18:35 PM):  not art
leah (20:18:44 PM):  I think a famous historical museum would be boring
ariel (20:19:02 PM):  yeah i agree to both of those
josh (20:19:40 PM):  ok so history and art are out of the question
david (20:19:41 PM):  it wouldnt be boring, but we have to consider its 5th graders - and it might be too dry for them - i mean, it would be too dry for me at points, but mostly i think it would enjoyable
ariel (20:19:58 PM):  you know like i do think that a interactive tour of a famous science museum could be fun
david (20:20:04 PM):  yeah, they're not real relateable for 5th graders, so we should cross those off josh
ariel (20:20:10 PM):  have any of you ever heard of the liberty science center?
cinthia (20:20:15 PM):  no
leah (20:20:19 PM):  no
josh (20:20:23 PM):  yea ive been there
david (20:20:25 PM):  the Boston Children's Science Museum is world class
david (20:20:47 PM):  its really, really good - i dont know the liberty science center though
cinthia (20:20:58 PM):  personally... i have an interactive science center at home near ithaca and it is awesome
david (20:20:59 PM):  wheres liberty
cinthia (20:21:08 PM):  but if we already have them why make more? make something different
josh (20:21:20 PM):  thats true
ariel (20:21:24 PM):  its so cool its very interactive... like to teach you touch perception they have a pitch black tunnel where kids can climb through with there families for quite a bit... to teach gravity they have a rock wall
david (20:21:26 PM):  yeah, Ithaca has a lot of those things despite being an otherwise small town, because of the university there
cinthia (20:21:52 PM):  have u been there ariel
david (20:21:55 PM):  well, the virtual world tour is different
cinthia (20:21:58 PM):  it was so much fun when i was little
ariel (20:22:07 PM):  link
david (20:22:12 PM):  yeah, they're all real interactive
ariel (20:22:14 PM):  yeah of course i have!
leah (20:22:18 PM):  i think if we did do the museums it should be a museum that they can't have a class trip to go to..
ariel (20:22:31 PM):  yeah i agree!
josh (20:22:36 PM):  ok so lets go down the list and weed out which ones we can use
ariel (20:22:47 PM):  it wouldnt limit the budet so much
josh (20:23:25 PM):  for which program will be easiest for students to learn and use? what woud you guys pick?
david (20:23:25 PM):  i've been to this one a bunch of times, its one minute from hanover, NH and where another school is , it's real good for kids - it's called Montshire Museum of Science and is for kids: link
cinthia (20:23:48 PM):  i would pick world
leah (20:24:01 PM):  marine life and wildlife
david (20:24:14 PM):  kids can use things related to wildlife, bc they have sounboards you press and a narrator comes on, and explains the wildlife and their habitat, etc. - and all the time the kids are looking at them
ariel (20:24:24 PM):  you know... i didnt think of this before but its costing $50,000!
david (20:24:36 PM):  i mean, wildlife and zoos are sometimes sad places, bc animals are trapped - but they might not be alive otherwise
cinthia (20:24:49 PM):  i actually am not sure id want a 3D animal one
ariel (20:24:51 PM):  I think perhaps that the science museum is not the best idea now actually
cinthia (20:24:53 PM):  you could just go to a zoo
josh (20:25:07 PM):  you could
leah (20:25:13 PM):  yea i just thought about that too
david (20:25:17 PM):  yeah, but a zoo isn't 3D -- its 4D - and we want something 3D -
ariel (20:25:18 PM):  yeah but you wouldnt see them as natural
david (20:25:18 PM):  haha
cinthia (20:25:32 PM):  like i work with kids and we always have local animal places bring in animals
cinthia (20:25:36 PM):  snakes frogs birds
ariel (20:25:42 PM):  yeah but 3D doesnt mean they would end up being polygonal
ariel (20:25:53 PM):  i mean the avatar movie looked so REAL and it wasent
josh (20:26:15 PM):  i like the geography
david (20:26:17 PM):  maybe they could see Avatar, i still haven't seen that - but yeah , this comment is relevant bc it shows whether kids would repsond to three dimensional exhibits, and i think its clear they would like it - and this movie had animals in it supposedly
cinthia (20:26:42 PM):  it was amazing
ariel (20:26:51 PM):  yeah it did and they were amazing looking animals
leah (20:26:58 PM):  thats a great point david
cinthia (20:26:59 PM):  and thats also a mythological world
josh (20:28:18 PM):  for which program has the most relatable and interesting content for students I think they would like the wildlife the most
cinthia (20:28:34 PM):  ya
leah (20:28:37 PM):  yeap
josh (20:28:42 PM):  kids are always interested in animals
david (20:28:43 PM):  yeah, definitely - they could have canus lupis, the North American Grey Wolf
david (20:29:04 PM):  they are really fierce and live in packs, so thats very interesting animal for kids i think
leah (20:29:41 PM):  yeap and they can see many exotic animals that exist in the amazon and not in a typical zoo
josh (20:29:48 PM):  yea
cinthia (20:30:07 PM):  true
david (20:30:08 PM):  yeah, they can see a giraffe -which you might not be able to see in a typical zoo
cinthia (20:30:24 PM):  i guess w animals and world u could see both aspects in eaxh
cinthia (20:30:29 PM):  each*
leah (20:30:41 PM):  yes its hard to choose
cinthia (20:30:54 PM):  im def between those two
josh (20:30:59 PM):  yea
josh (20:31:18 PM):  but then for the 3rd question (most important factor) which program will have the most educational impact when compared to or augmented by traditional teaching methods?
josh (20:31:37 PM):  I think the geography is the best
cinthia (20:31:47 PM):  ditto im partial tho
leah (20:32:11 PM):  im partial too
david (20:32:17 PM):  well - they could look at biosystems, or different types of climates and habitats, and learn about those aspects in the classroom - and then on the tour see the animals indiginous to each habitat
cinthia (20:33:01 PM):  exactly!
cinthia (20:33:20 PM):  i feel like that might have the most content
leah (20:33:34 PM):  definitely the most content
josh (20:34:26 PM):  yea that is very tru
cinthia (20:34:39 PM):  exactly
ariel (20:34:47 PM):  yeah i think they would get the most for there money with that as well
ariel (20:34:57 PM):  more content means they learn more
cinthia (20:35:18 PM):  more $?
leah (20:35:33 PM):  ??
ariel (20:35:48 PM):  yeah
david (20:35:49 PM):  yeah, it might cost a lot of money you mean?
cinthia (20:35:54 PM):  ya
cinthia (20:36:00 PM):  kinda wat ariel said
ariel (20:36:08 PM):  no we know it costs 50k right?
david (20:36:10 PM):  but we don't have to be concerned with cost
leah (20:36:14 PM):  right
josh (20:36:16 PM):  yea
ariel (20:36:17 PM):  so what im saying is that its a large topic to cover
david (20:36:17 PM):  oh yeah, we get 50
leah (20:36:24 PM):  mhm
josh (20:36:25 PM):  dont worry about the money
cinthia (20:38:07 PM):  i thoguht this was gonna be hard but it turned out pretty simple
ariel (20:38:16 PM):  yeah...
cinthia (20:38:20 PM):  i think everyone wants to travel the world and thats an interest even when your little
leah (20:38:20 PM):  yea it definitely did...
ariel (20:38:47 PM):  so we are all decided on the world tour then?
cinthia (20:38:59 PM):  aye
josh (20:39:21 PM):  yea and it is something that is very important to learn and it can be a little dry to learn in the traditional classroom
david (20:39:24 PM):  yeah
cinthia (20:39:41 PM):  i hated geo in school cuz there was no richness to it
cinthia (20:39:51 PM):  "here's where this country is.. memorize it:
david (20:39:52 PM):  yeah, this moves them out of the classroom - and is something they may not be able to do in real life, at that time
cinthia (20:39:53 PM):  "8
leah (20:40:01 PM):  yea so dry..
ariel (20:40:29 PM):  "8?
josh (20:40:49 PM):  yea whats 8?
david (20:40:53 PM):  8 what?
cinthia (20:40:57 PM):  i meant to say "*
cinthia (20:41:01 PM):  for a mistake earlier
leah (20:41:05 PM):  oooo
david (20:41:20 PM):  is that an abbreviation for mistake?
josh (20:41:21 PM):  ok
ariel (20:41:23 PM):  that hurts my brain
leah (20:41:31 PM):  yea the asterisk
david (20:41:32 PM):  8 stands for mistake?
cinthia (20:41:38 PM):  no the asterick does
david (20:41:45 PM):  on, an asterisk does - but you have the hold the shift key too
ariel (20:41:46 PM):  what asterisk?
david (20:41:51 PM):  it's above the 8
leah (20:41:56 PM):  lol
ariel (20:42:08 PM):  ok i get it now...
cinthia (20:42:29 PM):  im trying to do my hair and type at the same time sorry guys
ariel (20:42:48 PM):  LOL its ok
ariel (20:43:01 PM):  so... anyone have anything else to add to this?
leah (20:43:31 PM):  lol
josh (20:43:40 PM):  how about reason y we wouldnt pick geography
josh (20:43:53 PM):  just to make sure its the right choice
cinthia (20:44:14 PM):  i got nothin
leah (20:44:22 PM):  me neither
ariel (20:44:38 PM):  no idea
cinthia (20:44:50 PM):  i think it would be so much fun
cinthia (20:44:57 PM):  to go to "china" for the day
cinthia (20:45:10 PM):  like that commercial with the girl from juno
leah (20:45:17 PM):  mhmm
josh (20:45:31 PM):  the only thing i would say is that you dont always see all the different types of animals in a zoo sooo
ariel (20:45:33 PM):  geography is just important overall and pictures to help kids understand the conditions in each country would help their tolerance for other cultures i think
josh (20:46:04 PM):  the program could show kids every animal and show them in detail
david (20:46:06 PM):  yeah, it would teach tolerance - they could go to Holland, which is the capital of tolerance from a historical perspective
leah (20:46:27 PM):  learn about different cultures in general
ariel (20:46:49 PM):  yeah but are animals THAT important? i mean we could provide more understanding of their plight and chance of exstinction with a view of the big picture... like how the rain forest is disappearing
cinthia (20:47:11 PM):  true
josh (20:47:14 PM):  yea
david (20:47:19 PM):  yeah, or the icecaps melting and eliminating species
ariel (20:47:25 PM):  exactly
david (20:47:32 PM):  but how its better elimidavid them to make money for oil
ariel (20:47:36 PM):  i mean like tucan sam as much as the next dude but seriously
leah (20:47:47 PM):  lol
ariel (20:48:02 PM):  not every kid is gonna become a zoologist
david (20:48:08 PM):  its better to keep the animals, but they want to make more money i mean
ariel (20:48:34 PM):  we gotta understand we want to pick the topic that will be advantageous to all the kids
josh (20:48:48 PM):  true
josh (20:49:06 PM):  and the geography one would be that
ariel (20:49:07 PM):  so can we not get a new topic?
david (20:49:09 PM):  so i think world cultures is universal , everyone should learn this - yet are 5th graders able to have interest in this
david (20:49:20 PM):  as much as compared to animals?
ariel (20:49:28 PM):  i or should we bring out the clubs to beat this horse to death?
david (20:49:47 PM):  yeah, get your golf clubs - def.
leah (20:50:46 PM):  lol
ariel (20:50:47 PM):  *poke poke*
ariel (20:50:52 PM):  josh you dead?
josh (20:50:57 PM):  nope
ariel (20:51:03 PM):  damn
david (20:51:04 PM):  he was eaten by a wild animal
leah (20:51:08 PM):  haha
david (20:51:10 PM):  it got lose
ariel (20:51:14 PM):  LOL
josh (20:51:24 PM):  just tryin to think of something to say to try to spark the convo lol
leah (20:51:35 PM):  lol
cinthia (20:51:43 PM):  ignite the flam
cinthia (20:51:44 PM):  e
josh (20:52:15 PM):  im happy that it lasted this long lol
ariel (20:52:24 PM):  why what happened last time?
josh (20:52:30 PM):  i thought we were gunna be done in like 10 mins
josh (20:52:40 PM):  its an easy topic
ariel (20:52:40 PM):  oh well i had my bat with me
david (20:52:42 PM):  the gold medal game - it's going to be so good - Canada has a lot of animals that many American children might not be aware of - there are polar bears, seals, etc. - Canada versus U.S. the battle for the hockey soul of North America, tomorrow at 3 PM - except Canada owns hockey, so it will be tough to win but there are animals in Canada, and that is a culture we should have 5th graders learn about
ariel (20:53:31 PM):  LOL david way to keep your thoughts organized
ariel (20:53:40 PM):  i would probbaly shoot myself if i were your english teacher
david (20:54:10 PM):  they are related - bc we should have kids learn about our neighbors Mexico and Canada
david (20:54:19 PM):  to start with'
cinthia (20:54:19 PM):  true that david
david (20:54:33 PM):  yeah, its going to be sooo good - i can't wait
cinthia (20:54:40 PM):  even though they are our neighbors they pry know the least
leah (20:55:05 PM):  yea that is so true
josh (20:55:08 PM):  they should learn about the whole world so they can understand all the cultures
david (20:55:14 PM):  yeah, they may know much more about other countries, far away
ariel (20:55:29 PM):  oh damn im out of muncies
ariel (20:55:32 PM):  *munchies
ariel (20:55:34 PM):  brb
leah (20:56:59 PM):  so any other things to add??
cinthia (20:56:59 PM):  i wish i had food... but i am poor
leah (20:57:02 PM):  lol
david (20:57:52 PM):  you should shop at price chopper , they have the best prices for deals
cinthia (20:58:03 PM):  nahh walmart is way cheaper!
david (20:58:07 PM):  if u go to a big price chopper espc, like demlar/slingerlands, or niskayuna
david (20:58:36 PM):  really? somethings walmart might be cheaper - but there arent many walmarts
david (20:58:42 PM):  compared to price choppers
leah (20:58:48 PM):  yea i think walmart is cheaper
cinthia (20:59:18 PM):  true the big one on washington is amazing
david (20:59:45 PM):  wait, there is a walmart on washington ave?
leah (20:59:49 PM):  yeap it has alot of things for the most part
josh (20:59:58 PM):  it is but GEOGRAPHY wise its far away compared to pchopp
cinthia (21:00:01 PM):  its the biggest on the east coast
cinthia (21:00:11 PM):  ha josh tones
david (21:00:14 PM):  theres a walmart on washington ave? where?
cinthia (21:00:42 PM):  washington ave extension
leah (21:00:55 PM):  crossgates commons

david (21:01:20 PM):  thanks
cinthia (21:01:25 PM):  yeah u should

leah (21:01:43 PM):  yeap
david (21:02:14 PM):  wow, thats amazing - i def. should go there, thanks for the tip
josh (21:02:18 PM):  ok i got an idea
leah (21:02:24 PM):  lol
josh (21:03:13 PM):  how bout we talk about what would be taught in the geography program lol
ariel (21:03:15 PM):  that walmart at crossgates commons btw is the larges in the world
cinthia (21:03:16 PM):  wat
josh (21:03:23 PM):  jus to stay on topic

david (21:04:43 PM):  those guys , the Waltons, they all went to school at UArkansas
david (21:04:57 PM):  and three of them are on the the 15 richest list in the world
ariel (21:04:59 PM):  link
leah (21:05:04 PM):  i think they should teach history not just the history of the u.s.
cinthia (21:05:07 PM):  i want to go to uarkansas then
ariel (21:05:13 PM):  "Walmart SuperCenter largest in the country! Phone:(518) 869-4694  Map Location: Crossgates Commons "
david (21:06:03 PM):  right, its the largest WalMart Super Center in the country, but not the largest WalMart in the country
david (21:06:09 PM):  haha, nah ,im just kidding
leah (21:06:27 PM):  lol
david (21:06:29 PM):  its def. the biggest, i didnt realize that, thanks for the link - i've been spending too much money then all this time at Price Chopper
david (21:06:40 PM):  i wont go to the chopper again
leah (21:07:17 PM):  def save ur $$
david (21:07:29 PM):  yeah, thats what im looking to do
ariel (21:07:56 PM):  so geography ... ummm yeah
leah (21:07:59 PM):  lol
josh (21:08:00 PM):  ya
leah (21:08:07 PM):  rightttt...
josh (21:08:16 PM):  ok we got 20 mins left
ariel (21:08:45 PM):  so... geography is good! its ummm good to know where in this tiny world you are
ariel (21:08:52 PM):  and just how much of a spec you are
josh (21:08:52 PM):  so lets just try to finish it up with talking bout something with geography lol
leah (21:08:59 PM):  lol
leah (21:09:15 PM):  seasons and time zones are good to know
cinthia (21:09:22 PM):  oh yeah that would be fun
cinthia (21:10:18 PM):  ive always wondered what season diff countries are in while were in fall or spring or what not
josh (21:10:37 PM):  i think they should go to each country and tell about how its geography is then tell about the people that live there
david (21:10:44 PM):  u can look at the equator for that
david (21:10:55 PM):  australia is in summer right now for example
ariel (21:11:27 PM):  really?
ariel (21:11:33 PM):  well would you look at that
david (21:11:52 PM):  sarcasm - not really good for 5th graders
josh (21:12:04 PM):  nope
leah (21:12:24 PM):  lol
cinthia (21:12:47 PM):  5th graders are lil shits
cinthia (21:12:49 PM):  excuse my language
ariel (21:12:52 PM):  lol
cinthia (21:12:56 PM):  they are more sarcastic then our generation
david (21:13:13 PM):  yeah ariel, 5th graders arent responsive to wise comments - so u should keep in mind this is all for 5th graders, and not abuse them
leah (21:13:59 PM):  lol
ariel (21:14:16 PM):  the 5th graders are getting the computer program not our conversation
david (21:14:19 PM):  oh, im just being stupid and trying to elicit a reaction from ariel - this is
david (21:14:27 PM):  about studying online dialogue
david (21:16:09 PM):  they may be, yet the topic about seasons came up - and so a general rule of thumb is to consider the countrys distance from the equator in degrees of latitude, this is the best indicator for climate - NYS for example, is about 40 degrees latittude
david (21:16:28 PM):  which is similar to a place like South Korea for example, that also has similar winters and summers
ariel (21:16:32 PM):  dude i dont even know where countries are
david (21:16:34 PM):  so - kids could learn this on their tour
david (21:16:49 PM):  you know where they are
ariel (21:16:52 PM):  so i couldnt use that 40 degrees rule if you paied me
cinthia (21:17:04 PM):  true
ariel (21:17:10 PM):  hence why i believe this is the best choice of a program
ariel (21:17:14 PM):  man i wish i had it as a kid
ariel (21:17:22 PM):  computers were crap when i was a kid
david (21:17:27 PM):  she knows where countries are, she's just pretending she doesnt - maybe
leah (21:17:46 PM):  lol
david (21:17:49 PM):  yeah, i bet computer programs today are way better at teaching geograhy
josh (21:18:02 PM):  def better
josh (21:18:22 PM):  you can access so much more info
cinthia (21:18:58 PM):  i wish i could do it all over again
leah (21:19:06 PM):  yea
josh (21:20:20 PM):  yea we would learn so much more and it would be easier
leah (21:20:43 PM):  it'd be a lot easier
cinthia (21:22:38 PM):  well im glad that was so easy
cinthia (21:22:41 PM):  and lasted so long
david (21:22:44 PM):  yeah - itd be better - we can still learn it though, or even still us those programs
david (21:22:53 PM):  some are for adults too i bet
ariel (21:23:33 PM):  so...
ariel (21:23:38 PM):  7 min left!
leah (21:23:43 PM):  lol
josh (21:23:57 PM):  its gunna be a long 7 mins lol
ariel (21:23:58 PM):  are they having us sign up for more of these?
ariel (21:24:00 PM):  or ...

josh (21:24:37 PM):  yea there is one more but idk if there are more after that
leah (21:24:56 PM):  yea b/c they canceled so many
cinthia (21:25:21 PM):  really?
cinthia (21:25:23 PM):  why
ariel (21:25:35 PM):  no idea
leah (21:25:52 PM):  certain people didnt have access to internet when the storm hit
david (21:26:09 PM):  they could go to the campus library
david (21:26:22 PM):  but , that must be bad not to have power
moderator (21:26:51 PM):  Hello everyone. As we near the end I'd like to remind everyone to please fill out the survey before you leave.

mara (1:01:08 PM):  thats cool
amy (1:01:13 PM):  oh  nice
meg (1:01:27 PM):  I'm in the same boat, coffee right next to me!
vincent (1:01:46 PM):  yeah, i had just enough time to start some coffee, I woke up 2 minutes before I logged in.
meg (1:02:12 PM):  Well, that works into the topic too right?
mara (1:02:27 PM):  coffee makers?
vincent (1:02:36 PM):  yeah, for sure.  the fact that I can be in bed using the internet.
vincent (1:02:48 PM):  chatting with people across the country.
george (1:02:49 PM):  Lars Ulrich might have a thing or two to say about technology
amy (1:02:51 PM):  wow well that already shows us something about technology-  that it is keeping people more involved more often at not so great times
vincent (1:03:28 PM):  as a drummer, Lars Ulrich references kind of make me cringe!
amy (1:03:35 PM):  who is lars?
vincent (1:03:41 PM):  Metallica drummer
george (1:03:42 PM):  haha
george (1:03:52 PM):  he's drummer for metallica
vincent (1:04:13 PM):  yeah, if I had to go out to a computer lab or something, I wouldn't have made it today
george (1:04:15 PM):  there was a recent article about him downloading his own leaked album before it went on the shelves
meg (1:04:31 PM):  i'm in the computer lab. i just made it
meg (1:04:36 PM):  hahaha
meg (1:04:42 PM):  that's actually kind of ridiculous
amy (1:05:09 PM):  i'm taking a class which is all about information in our environment  so i've been thinking a lot about all thechanges thatave taken place in such a short amt of time
mara (1:05:20 PM):  yeah the ILS people loaned me this computer
vincent (1:05:28 PM):  I was thinking about some of this stuff... I've been in bands since I was a kid, and I remember going on tour... BEFORE MAPQUEST!!
amy (1:05:34 PM):  and all the information much more accesible to us now more than ever
meg (1:06:05 PM):  I actually went on a 3 hr drive yesterday, and my boyfriend was amazed that i just used a map instead of his GPS
vincent (1:06:10 PM):  i totally take it for granted now, but we got lost like every single day
amy (1:06:28 PM):  hahaha  its still possible to exisit without all the technology
vincent (1:06:41 PM):  we had to get our directions to each club over the phone, and it's like "turn left at the brick building, and then you'll see a weird tree, than turn right"
amy (1:06:53 PM):  google and mapquest have def made my life more livable-
mara (1:07:03 PM):  what about text messaging
mara (1:07:06 PM):  ?
amy (1:07:07 PM):  hahaha   took so much more time
meg (1:07:20 PM):  I hate texting. I'd rather just talk on the phone
amy (1:07:26 PM):  i'm not into texting as much as just calling someone
amy (1:07:34 PM):  mara  are you a texter?
vincent (1:07:38 PM):  I like texting, mostly for jokes, sometimes for quick info relay.
amy (1:08:05 PM):  do you text from work, class, store, etc?
vincent (1:08:11 PM):  like if you want to just say "meet me at 12th and Main St. at 4pm," that conversation on the phone would take like 5 minutes
meg (1:08:13 PM):  Yeah, i guess its easier when you can't talk
mara (1:08:21 PM):  yes very much so, but not in class and shit like that where people do stuff to be rude
amy (1:08:25 PM):  mm i see
meg (1:08:29 PM):  I text when im in the library
george (1:08:55 PM):  yea texting on a bus or train feels more comfortable than talking
amy (1:09:02 PM):  what about cell phone use in general
meg (1:09:07 PM):  but i'm so SLOW!
vincent (1:09:13 PM):  yeah.  and it's good at parties or loud shows, etc.
mara (1:09:21 PM):  i love it how there are NO CELL PHONES signs everywhere
amy (1:09:34 PM):  i'venotices that too- the signs
amy (1:09:51 PM):  sorry for my typos-  new laptop, not used to the keypad
george (1:09:59 PM):  they have jammers installed in some places
vincent (1:10:07 PM):  there aren't too many No Phones signes in Seattle, just in the food co-op and some coffee shops
meg (1:10:23 PM):  on campus they're everywhere
vincent (1:10:28 PM):  most signs say "please don't come to the register if you're still on the phone" which is cool, that annoying
amy (1:10:31 PM):  get this...there is a cafe in the saratoga region
vincent (1:10:35 PM):  that's
amy (1:10:54 PM):  that has a sign saying that technology is not allowed-  so that means computers, phones, etc
vincent (1:10:55 PM):  yes?
vincent (1:11:05 PM):  what about pacemakers?
mara (1:11:16 PM):  what where?
amy (1:11:21 PM):  i think tech. for non heatlh related issues
george (1:11:28 PM):  sorry sir, you'll have to remove that
vincent (1:11:33 PM):  jokes
amy (1:11:33 PM):  somewhere in saratoga- there was an article recently
amy (1:11:40 PM):  lol
amy (1:11:52 PM):  she says she was working for a telecommun. company
meg (1:11:59 PM):  that's a good thing- it probably gives people a break from being constantly on the phone/email
vincent (1:12:08 PM):  a lot of the really busy coffee shops here turn off the wireless on weekends
meg (1:12:46 PM):  i can't imagine living without the internet though
amy (1:12:50 PM):  i like a break from it i find   its easy to get caught up
amy (1:13:08 PM):  me neither-  i access most info off the internet
mara (1:13:08 PM):  in europe they have those internet cafes
vincent (1:13:28 PM):  yeah
amy (1:13:47 PM):  are you guys big tv watchers?
mara (1:13:51 PM):  i read books! hha
meg (1:14:06 PM):  i like TV but i don't have cable (no time/money)
vincent (1:14:12 PM):  My house doesn't get tv, but some of us watch shows on DVD
george (1:14:21 PM):  i watch a few tv shows, mostly online :P
meg (1:14:26 PM):  i watch lost online
meg (1:14:30 PM):  and the office
amy (1:14:34 PM):  cant we compare the computer to tv in some ways -  people were facincated bytha when was new
vincent (1:14:38 PM):  I watch Lost online!  that's my one show.
mara (1:14:54 PM):  sex and the city, big love, and house!
vincent (1:14:58 PM):  but TV is a one-way street, it just comes at you
amy (1:15:04 PM):  lost is my show too, and office is my second
meg (1:15:10 PM):  LOST is awesome.
meg (1:15:15 PM):  i'm 3 weeks behind!
mara (1:15:18 PM):  ohhh office is good too
amy (1:15:19 PM):  nic, absolutely
vincent (1:15:34 PM):  3 heavy weeks, meg.
amy (1:15:41 PM):  i mean, the technology and people getting caught up
vincent (1:15:47 PM):  right.
meg (1:15:55 PM):  I'm planning on catchin up over spring break.
amy (1:16:13 PM):  like how people used to and still say how kids watch oo much tv...now they are saying they sit at computer too much-  similaritiy
meg (1:16:18 PM):  I'm actually taking a class right now on Globalization and technology is a majoy party of it
meg (1:16:27 PM):  *major
vincent (1:16:29 PM):  yeah, tht's true.
meg (1:16:30 PM):  part
amy (1:16:36 PM):  ooh interestin meg
meg (1:17:05 PM):  it's like in the past 30 years the increase in mass communications changed the whole way people approach the global communit
meg (1:17:06 PM):  y
mara (1:17:19 PM):  how about the parental controls on computers/tvs/ and even cars now!?
vincent (1:17:30 PM):  it's weird how we sort of secretly think of our technology as a part of ourselves... like if I lose my phone, I feel like I lost a part of my brain
george (1:17:37 PM):  it's weird, i haven't thought much about the impact technology has had...i just use it :P
amy (1:18:00 PM):  what are the controls in cars mara?
mara (1:18:24 PM):  they have this new car... i dont know much about it
meg (1:18:28 PM):  it's like we're trained to have technology as a part of our lives
meg (1:18:42 PM):  like the window locks
meg (1:18:43 PM):  ?
amy (1:19:02 PM):  oh right
mara (1:19:03 PM):  but it cant go outside certain perameters and after 9pm the engine wont turn on plus the radio can only go so loud
george (1:19:09 PM):  oh that makes sense now...i was wondering why a car would need parental controls
mara (1:19:22 PM):  Noooo way more involved than locking windows ha
amy (1:19:28 PM):  ohhh  i never heard of that!  wow!
meg (1:19:29 PM):  ohhh for kids who a re learning?
meg (1:19:38 PM):  to drive
meg (1:19:58 PM):  sounds safer
vincent (1:20:07 PM):  the weird part is thinking about the next progressions... phones and computers keep getting smaller and then combine, and... most likely, people think... start just getting implanted in us
amy (1:20:19 PM):  i also wonder if volume of car stereo affects how people drive
george (1:20:27 PM):  hey i'm all for that!
vincent (1:20:33 PM):  or they think it will start with phones being implanted in clothing, etc.
george (1:20:38 PM):  make me into a cyborg plz
meg (1:20:45 PM):  i wouldn't like that
mara (1:20:48 PM):  yeah thats kinda like the blackberry... has all in one so far
meg (1:20:50 PM):  robots are evil right?
amy (1:20:54 PM):  wow  never thought of tech like that being impantted
meg (1:20:54 PM):  hahhaah
amy (1:20:58 PM):  lol
meg (1:21:04 PM):  or the iPhon
meg (1:21:08 PM):  e
george (1:21:11 PM):  they sell a t-shirt with wi-fi detection on thinkgeek
vincent (1:21:11 PM):  not the Terminator!
amy (1:21:13 PM):  i-robot
mara (1:21:28 PM):  link
mara (1:21:39 PM):  its a ford car... check out the blog
amy (1:21:56 PM):  oh thanks- i will save and read that
vincent (1:22:10 PM):  yeah, the iphone, but smaller and smaller and smaller... until we basically will be able to almost "psychically" communicate, because it's just somewhere in our brain
george (1:22:13 PM):  how about a garmin gps navigation system implanted in our heads
vincent (1:22:27 PM):  yeah
amy (1:22:33 PM):  oh its shor-  just read it already   Lol
amy (1:23:01 PM):  thats reall scary!  would people want to do that??
mara (1:23:10 PM):  "Ford has announced MyKey, a kind of parental control for cars. Paranoid parents (that is, all parents) can program the key to limit certain car functions, including top speed. There is also a seatbelt reminder, an alarm which can be set to sound at 45, 55 and 65 miles per hour, and the low fuel warning can be set to go off earlier (to "improve fuel efficiency")."
vincent (1:23:28 PM):  probably like cell phones, only a few people liked them at first, then it spreads...
vincent (1:23:33 PM):  wow, that's cool.
meg (1:23:52 PM):  idk i wouldn't have liked that when i was learning to drive
mara (1:23:56 PM):  "MyKey also comes with a volume limiter for the car stereo, so there will be no more bad, loud hip-hop at the traffic lights. "
george (1:24:04 PM):  actually come to think of that, a lot of cars have electronic limiters in them...that's not new
meg (1:24:06 PM):  don't most cars have seatbelt reminder now?
mara (1:24:14 PM):  ME EITHER you need your freedom
meg (1:24:26 PM):  hahaha "bad loud hip-hop"
meg (1:24:37 PM):  what about freedom of expression?
mara (1:24:37 PM):  yeah they do haha unless its a old used car these kids are getting
amy (1:24:42 PM):  hehe
vincent (1:24:46 PM):  "bad, loud hip-hop" is a quote?
mara (1:25:08 PM):  well what im trying to pose is that fact that technology has furthered but so have the ways of limiting it?
mara (1:25:13 PM):  feels weird to me!
george (1:25:16 PM):  i wonder if they can get it to disable hydrolics in gang bangers cars
vincent (1:25:52 PM):  I bet there's no kid over 10 years old that can't out-hack their parents at stuff like this, though
amy (1:26:10 PM):  definitely limits-  like with the internet-   copyright issues
vincent (1:26:11 PM):  hydraulics are played out, no one rocks them anymore
george (1:26:12 PM):  i was just thinking that
meg (1:26:15 PM):  there's limits to technology, but where's the line between personal choice and the limits?
vincent (1:26:29 PM):  that's 90s!
george (1:26:46 PM):  haha
amy (1:26:49 PM):  meg, for example?  interesting
amy (1:27:17 PM):  like the car radio volumt being limited?
mara (1:27:26 PM):  good question meg.... this girl in my class gets phone calls in class and answers them on her way out the door!  \
meg (1:27:26 PM):  like, basically with the issue of censorship, where's the line between regulations of technology and personal choices about hwo to use it
george (1:27:28 PM):  kids need to band together and complain about infringement on their constitutional rights
meg (1:27:36 PM):  UGH I hate that
vincent (1:27:40 PM):  but that's just a level that parents set, right?  not like an industry-wide volume setting...
meg (1:27:47 PM):  I had a professor answer the phone of one of their students
george (1:27:48 PM):  start an anti-parental controls movement
mara (1:28:05 PM):  hahah AWESOME!
meg (1:28:13 PM):  it is and it isnt- think TV commercials that pay stations to lower their volume so that they can make them louder
meg (1:28:28 PM):  them=their commercials
amy (1:28:29 PM):  i think with all the new tech. people need to learn new etiquette...problem is....no one knows whatthat is Yet
meg (1:28:45 PM):  etiquette or common sense?
amy (1:28:59 PM):  both-
vincent (1:29:01 PM):  and stuff is progressing so fast, that things like etiquette don't have time to get established
meg (1:29:08 PM):  hahaha
meg (1:29:21 PM):  it doesnt?
amy (1:29:22 PM):  kids growign up around their parents today are not necessarily learning what is "right"
meg (1:29:31 PM):  cell phones have been out for years
amy (1:29:34 PM):  right vincent-
meg (1:29:37 PM):  so has the internet
mara (1:29:56 PM):  so have cars!
mara (1:29:58 PM):  lol
george (1:30:01 PM):  perhaps the answer isn't an evolving etiquette...but better filters
meg (1:30:06 PM):  hahaha
meg (1:30:36 PM):  howso?
amy (1:30:39 PM):  heres something funny.....in myclass we were talking about talking on cells at  stores and in classrooms, etc
mara (1:30:58 PM):  like what about violent video games? how can those be censored?
meg (1:31:17 PM):  they have ratings- like E/everyone, M/mature
vincent (1:31:18 PM):  wait, where did that class discussion go
vincent (1:31:21 PM):  ?
amy (1:31:22 PM):  then only about 30 mins later when a group was presenting a project....someone took out his cell phone and started doing something- texting, lookin online,  i'm not sure
meg (1:31:27 PM):  now people just need to follow them
george (1:31:28 PM):  there's parental settings in some games
vincent (1:31:33 PM):  oh man
george (1:31:46 PM):  you can limit the gore level
mara (1:31:52 PM):  yeah but... that doesnt stop thngs from happeneing like the MyKey thing
vincent (1:31:57 PM):  it's just like movie ratings... I mean everyone I know saw rated-R movies at really young ages.  probably the same with games
george (1:32:11 PM):  tho i guess it's hard to censor "sexting"
mara (1:32:13 PM):  I HATE WHEN STUDENTS DO THAT AMY!
vincent (1:32:15 PM):  more now, because kids can download stuff in their rooms
vincent (1:32:30 PM):  ha, sexting!
mara (1:32:53 PM):  sorry but im a TA in a huge lecture and whenever i see a student on their phone i call them out on it
vincent (1:33:00 PM):  but that's just the same as talking on the phone, can't censor that.
amy (1:33:02 PM):  i just heard that term the other day- secxting   ugh
meg (1:33:05 PM):  its necessary
vincent (1:33:06 PM):  and we shouldn't try
amy (1:33:16 PM):  dont most teachers now say no phones
mara (1:33:22 PM):  sam thing if they come in late... i dont mean to be embarressing but they are waisting everyones time
george (1:33:22 PM):  haha
vincent (1:33:36 PM):  have you heard about the ringtone that old people can't hear???
meg (1:33:38 PM):  in some of my grad classes, i've seen people check their cells and it's like you're in GRAD SCHOOL!
meg (1:33:52 PM):  hahaha
meg (1:33:58 PM):  what ringtone?
amy (1:34:02 PM):  i'm in grad too-  people dont now or dont care
meg (1:34:24 PM):  it's funny too because when these people start teaching they'll see how annoying it is
vincent (1:34:33 PM):  there's some frequency that most people stop being able to hear when they're over about 30, so kids use that as their rington and the techer can't hear it!
mara (1:34:39 PM):  yup me too meg
meg (1:34:51 PM):  have you ever had a professor's phone go off?
amy (1:35:06 PM):  lol  no ihavent YET
meg (1:35:50 PM):  my professor had his wife call and had the whole class say HI
meg (1:35:51 PM):  hahaha
mara (1:35:54 PM):  yes once and she had this rule that if it went off she would leave class
meg (1:35:57 PM):  it was hilarious
vincent (1:36:02 PM):  weird
mara (1:36:05 PM):  and the same went for the students if theirs went off they left class
amy (1:36:10 PM):  thats setting a poor example
george (1:36:13 PM):  :-o
mara (1:36:19 PM):  it was awesome we got the day off!
amy (1:36:40 PM):  so limits need to be in place somehow
meg (1:36:45 PM):  yeah but it was a guest lecturer so he couldn't really help that she was calling at a time that he usually dind't have class
amy (1:36:54 PM):  we justcame back to that
george (1:37:10 PM):  jammers, imo
amy (1:37:21 PM):  signs
meg (1:37:25 PM):  it's really annoying when people just have it on vibrate too instead of silent- everyone can still hear it
george (1:37:30 PM):  they actually have portable jammers, but i think there might be some legality issues with those
vincent (1:37:34 PM):  I think jammers are illegal... like if there was a medical emergency and no one could call 911
meg (1:37:34 PM):  or just etiquette
meg (1:37:34 PM):  ?
amy (1:37:50 PM):  oh  great point vincent
meg (1:37:52 PM):  what about land lines?
george (1:37:56 PM):  you can enable jammers in movie theaters and classes tho
meg (1:38:05 PM):  they still have them
george (1:38:13 PM):  in fact i believe some theaters have them enabled
vincent (1:38:32 PM):  I guess there's a landline in the lobby, probably
george (1:38:39 PM):  that's something i noticed recently...there's almost no pay phones left!
vincent (1:38:40 PM):  that makes sense
meg (1:38:48 PM):  it's true
meg (1:38:54 PM):  no one uses them
vincent (1:39:06 PM):  yeah, I didn't have a phone for years, and always looked for payphones in cities... so weird.
vincent (1:39:27 PM):  there are still some in the NY subway, because phones don't work down there
meg (1:39:42 PM):  thats good
george (1:39:48 PM):  there's a few at the airports too
amy (1:40:03 PM):  but cell phones are supposed to be here for convenience and provide better ways of communicating so we dont want to limit their use for health-related or emergency reasons
meg (1:40:04 PM):  and in the supermarkets there's still usually one
mara (1:40:24 PM):  i havent had a land line in forever
vincent (1:40:32 PM):  all those european internet cafes are phone centers, too
meg (1:40:35 PM):  i read an article that said cell phone use leads to brain tumors
amy (1:40:55 PM):  i prefer the land line actually for clearness.   i've heard the tumor thing also
meg (1:40:55 PM):  which means that although its more convenient, is it really healthier?
vincent (1:40:56 PM):  I heard that, too.  no one seems to be really looking into it.
amy (1:41:13 PM):  has anything been proven about cell usage though
george (1:41:15 PM):  brain tumor is a small price to pay for such a convenience!
meg (1:41:19 PM):  they say a way to prevent is to switch ears
amy (1:41:24 PM):  lol
meg (1:41:26 PM):  not use just one
vincent (1:41:28 PM):  ha
meg (1:41:32 PM):  hahaha
vincent (1:41:44 PM):  really? just switch ears?
mara (1:41:46 PM):  oh and whats the thing about no cell phones at the gas pump?
george (1:41:49 PM):  i've read that you can get tumors in other places if you keep it in your pocket
vincent (1:41:49 PM):  oh
vincent (1:42:08 PM):  it's static electricity, so it could potentially spark the gas fumes
meg (1:42:35 PM):  thats actually NOT true
meg (1:42:42 PM):  myth busters
vincent (1:42:45 PM):  really?
meg (1:42:48 PM):  proved it wrong!
vincent (1:42:58 PM):  cool
meg (1:43:04 PM):  hahaha
mara (1:43:07 PM):  thank god for myth busters
amy (1:43:08 PM):  How has technology changed your social/ family lives?
meg (1:43:10 PM):  thats such a great show
meg (1:43:16 PM):  thats what i miss about TV
vincent (1:43:29 PM):  seriously, now I know how legit MacGuyver was
meg (1:43:37 PM):  well facebook? all my family is on there
mara (1:43:51 PM):  well im three hours from my family so thank god for cell and chats like these
vincent (1:43:52 PM):  Do you guys use Skype at all?  That's been amazing for me and my parents
amy (1:43:54 PM):  how has that changes things for you keri?
meg (1:44:04 PM):  I love skype
meg (1:44:15 PM):  um, its hard to choose what people see
mara (1:44:18 PM):  no by me friends skype i never tired it
meg (1:44:27 PM):  i don't want my fam to see all my drunk photos
george (1:44:29 PM):  i've chatted with my gf online while she was in the next room
vincent (1:44:32 PM):  yeah!
vincent (1:44:40 PM):  ha1
vincent (1:44:50 PM):  I text my roomates when they're upstairs.
vincent (1:45:03 PM):  but coast to coast, the video chat stuff is so cool for famiily
george (1:45:03 PM):  well, normally i could just walk about 10 feet and talk with her in person hehe
amy (1:45:04 PM):  has facebook improved your lives?
mara (1:45:06 PM):  LAZY!! lol
vincent (1:45:30 PM):  facebook is fun, but it hasn't really "improve my life" I guess
george (1:45:34 PM):  order flowers onine instead of picking them out at the store
vincent (1:45:35 PM):  improved
amy (1:45:36 PM):  that happened lastnight at a party-  someone texted tosomeone in another room
meg (1:45:42 PM):  facebook is good but its also kind of a pain
meg (1:46:13 PM):  i mean its good for keeping in touch
george (1:46:14 PM):  hey have you heard of peapod and webvan?
amy (1:46:15 PM):  do you think facebook among other sites is a way for people to reconnect because people move all over the world now rather than staying in the community they grew up in?
meg (1:46:22 PM):  no?
george (1:46:32 PM):  i've actually done my grocery shopping online and had it delivered to me!
amy (1:46:37 PM):  no
vincent (1:46:39 PM):  I'm in touch with a few people I wouldn't have been... but mostly I ignore most of my facebook friends and just interact with my good friends
meg (1:46:43 PM):  to the peapod question
meg (1:46:44 PM):  hahaha
meg (1:46:54 PM):  im with vincent
mara (1:47:23 PM):  i have found that more and more older people like my mom are on facebook now
vincent (1:47:23 PM):  but many of those are in NY or other faraway places, so it's cool.
meg (1:47:24 PM):  with fb people get caught up on checking their news feed
meg (1:47:33 PM):  and not actually being in the real world

meg (1:50:02 PM):  with skype?
meg (1:50:07 PM):  its not bad
george (1:50:12 PM):  wow...imagine being a parent of 9 kids
vincent (1:50:15 PM):  I've had to learn to let go... knowing that my Aunt can see all of my questionable lifestyle on facebook
amy (1:50:15 PM):  to use to see my parents who are vacationing for a few months
george (1:50:23 PM):  need herding skills
amy (1:50:30 PM):  my brother old me to try google
amy (1:50:44 PM):  does you aunt say anything to you about it vincent?
vincent (1:50:45 PM):  your parents will love it
mara (1:50:48 PM):  just make sure you know who you are talking to... hah isnt that part of this study!?  how people lie about identities and get others to give up info about themselves
george (1:51:09 PM):  yea you can lose your job if you put the wrong stuff on facebook
vincent (1:51:10 PM):  is it?
amy (1:51:18 PM):  i really want to ry it so i can see my cats they took with them  LOL
meg (1:51:20 PM):  or makes it harder to get a job
vincent (1:51:21 PM):  so weird.
meg (1:51:38 PM):  awww i would miss my cat
amy (1:51:46 PM):  but cant you setprivacy on fb so only your friends see your stuff?
meg (1:51:57 PM):  i have it set so no one can see my pics
vincent (1:52:04 PM):  No she hasn't said anything... and really there's not much to say.  Yes, I drink, do some drugs, etc.  Nice to see you Aunt Roxanne!
meg (1:52:11 PM):  and can only be found by friends of friends
amy (1:52:12 PM):  meg-  they know i want to use the webcam just to see the cats more than them  hehehe  they are cool about it  :)
meg (1:52:20 PM):  hahaha
meg (1:52:27 PM):  how many cats?
amy (1:52:35 PM):  so with fb, how can you potential employers see you?
meg (1:52:38 PM):  i have one big fat tabby, he looks like garfield!
amy (1:52:43 PM):  2 cats    one is 17 and the other is 9
vincent (1:52:49 PM):  ooh, the weirdest part is religion stuff... I've never told my extended family that I stopped believing!
meg (1:52:52 PM):  depends on your privacy?
meg (1:53:01 PM):  ouch
meg (1:53:15 PM):  that makes for interesting fb material
amy (1:53:25 PM):  so shouldnt a rule be if you use fb for fun then set our settings.  if you use it to network dont include personal stuff?
george (1:53:38 PM):  believing in what?
amy (1:53:38 PM):  your settings
vincent (1:53:45 PM):  in God, or whatever.
george (1:53:46 PM):  er...what religion?
vincent (1:53:58 PM):  you name it!
vincent (1:54:06 PM):  but my family is Catholic
george (1:54:22 PM):  ah
vincent (1:54:27 PM):  so they can see that I'm "not Catholic" on facebook
meg (1:54:29 PM):  its hard to draw a line bw personal and networking stuff though
amy (1:54:50 PM):  why
mara (1:54:53 PM):  i have "destiny" as my religion on facebook ha
george (1:54:56 PM):  what's it set at?  atheist? agnostic?
vincent (1:55:08 PM):  mine is "surrealism"
meg (1:55:12 PM):  esp because i've had my fb for like, 5 yrs and didn't know i'd end up probably using it for networking on it rather than friend stuff
meg (1:55:17 PM):  mine is pastafarian
vincent (1:55:32 PM):  ha!
meg (1:55:38 PM):  i.e. fsm
meg (1:55:45 PM):  hahaha
george (1:55:49 PM):  pastafarian?!  spaghetti religion!
amy (1:55:54 PM):  i see meg.  mythought is that i have a social site (fb) and a networking site (linkedin) thati keep separate
meg (1:55:56 PM):  flying spaghetti monster!
vincent (1:56:01 PM):  I'd go to that church!
george (1:56:30 PM):  amen!
meg (1:56:35 PM):  yeah but with all my profs on fb i had to edit and change what i wanted them to see...
vincent (1:56:49 PM):  I've heard of Linkedin, never checked it out.  I'm very unprofessional.
amy (1:56:55 PM):  u are friends with professors?
meg (1:56:56 PM):  i love the FSM website
meg (1:57:09 PM):  with a couple. my advisor
mara (1:57:09 PM):  NO!
amy (1:57:12 PM):  hehe  i just found linked in bc the school program put up a page and is promoting it
mara (1:57:26 PM):  lol then they would see my drinking pics... and god knows what they might think about me
george (1:57:27 PM):  brb bio
meg (1:57:43 PM):  hahaha thats why my pics are hidden
vincent (1:57:50 PM):  college!  who doesn't drink?  why is it weird for people to see that you drink?
amy (1:58:03 PM):  the whole getting a job thing probably
mara (1:58:08 PM):  its weird for my profs to see it
meg (1:58:14 PM):  i was watching this thing about how you can use fb to show what employers want to see
meg (1:58:27 PM):  like that you're well rounded, etc
vincent (1:58:34 PM):  my professors knew that kids drink.
mara (1:58:45 PM):  yeah but not that i drink ha
meg (1:58:51 PM):  i've drunk with my profs before hahahaha
vincent (1:58:52 PM):  ha!
meg (1:58:57 PM):  at the department parties
vincent (1:58:59 PM):  me too.
amy (1:59:02 PM):  wow so will some people have an advantage over others if they use technology in this way?  so that a resume and cover letter wont count as much anmore?  hmmmm never thought thatbefore
meg (1:59:04 PM):  they're FUNNY.
vincent (1:59:10 PM):  I had a professor buy me weed once.
george (1:59:18 PM):  if you don't drink, you could always photoshop yourself drinking!
meg (1:59:26 PM):  idk... i mean i still have a resume
meg (1:59:29 PM):  and a cv
vincent (1:59:32 PM):  ha
meg (1:59:47 PM):  but after watching that i changed who could see what
meg (2:00:13 PM):  and i delete people i don't really know or are just acquantainces
vincent (2:00:58 PM):  I have some people I want to delete, but feel weird about it
meg (2:01:12 PM):  why?
mara (2:01:27 PM):  yeah i changed my privacy settings after my mom got on facebook haha
meg (2:01:52 PM):  theres some pics you just don't want your mom seeing
george (2:01:58 PM):  facebook politics are fascinating
meg (2:01:58 PM):  haha
amy (2:02:02 PM):  can u change it for indiviudals and whatey can see?
vincent (2:02:03 PM):  not sure... it just seems... mean?  a rejection?  they invited me, and I accepted, and then I deny them later?
meg (2:02:12 PM):  has anyone used the friendslist thing?
meg (2:02:15 PM):  i think so
vincent (2:02:26 PM):  what's that?
meg (2:02:28 PM):  yeah
amy (2:02:44 PM):  to group people by category?  like school, work, sports friends?
mara (2:02:50 PM):  yeah duh!  i mean ive been living on my own forever now but whenever i go home she still talks to me about how late im staying out and blah so i have to hide that from her at school and stuff
meg (2:02:54 PM):  but they can see your information, your personal life and idk, it almost feels like an invasion of privacy... and yes to amy
amy (2:03:14 PM):  idk  what is that?
meg (2:03:23 PM):  thats waht it is
meg (2:03:34 PM):  on fb you can group people and then choose which groups see what
amy (2:03:39 PM):  what does that stand for?  i dont now the phrase
vincent (2:03:46 PM):  I just read an article about how kids who are growing up with Facebook already established... they have totally new ideas about what privacy means or is worth...
vincent (2:03:54 PM):  IDK = I Don't Know
amy (2:04:02 PM):  ohhhh  thnks
meg (2:04:05 PM):  oh woops
meg (2:04:13 PM):  i totally misunderstood
meg (2:04:13 PM):  hahahah
amy (2:04:40 PM):  kids growing up now know nothing other than internet   -weird to me
vincent (2:04:53 PM):  I wouldn't say nothing...
meg (2:04:54 PM):  my room mate is a caretaker for elementary school kids and a 10 year old friended her on fb last week!
meg (2:04:57 PM):  10!
amy (2:04:57 PM):  i hope they are able to decipher good from bad information / sources
vincent (2:05:02 PM):  but yeah, mostly.
mara (2:05:27 PM):  yeah whenever my little sisters and brothers come over they are always like can i get on your computer... ugh its like they get so bored so easy
vincent (2:05:27 PM):  imagine all your super awkward growing-up years, broadcast live on the internet!
meg (2:05:41 PM):  no, thank you
amy (2:05:45 PM):  i remember using the encyclopedia for school projects... do kids know waht  that is today?  lol
meg (2:05:46 PM):  i'd rather not imagine that
george (2:06:05 PM):  there's a lot of disturbing stuff on the internet, and kids have free access to it
meg (2:06:09 PM):  doubtul
vincent (2:06:17 PM):  that's why privacy is going to be almost like an old-fashioned idea when these kids are older
george (2:06:22 PM):  in fact, they look for it to shock their friends to see reactions
amy (2:06:31 PM):  i hope they are being taught what it is and how valuable it is though
meg (2:07:08 PM):  yeah but then there's the whole question of what is being recorded and shown to the world and how that eventually effects their school/professional lives
george (2:07:13 PM):  on youtube, there's an enormous amount of "reaction videos" of people filming themselves watching awful videos on the internet
amy (2:07:27 PM):  ?
vincent (2:07:31 PM):  yeah, I've seen those
amy (2:07:42 PM):  what purpose does hat serve though
vincent (2:07:45 PM):  it's more filming their friends, who haven't seen the thing before.
george (2:07:55 PM):  "reaction to pain olympics"
george (2:08:20 PM):  but the thing is...those videos they are watching are on sites anybody can go to
meg (2:08:41 PM):  they can but there's also privacy settings for youtube
george (2:08:45 PM):  in a sense, youtube is like a funnel to those sites
meg (2:08:48 PM):  but who really uses them
vincent (2:08:52 PM):  yeah.  kids today are going to have a REALLY high tolerance for what's "gross" or "inappropriate" or "dirty"
meg (2:09:08 PM):  my fav youtube video is puppy whistle!
meg (2:09:10 PM):  hahaha
vincent (2:09:21 PM):  nice
george (2:09:40 PM):  i'm going to have to look that up now!
amy (2:09:41 PM):  i dont know it  i'll have to look later  lol
meg (2:09:44 PM):  yeah, its a good way to procrastinate
meg (2:09:51 PM):  its SO cute!
meg (2:09:54 PM):  hahaha
george (2:10:29 PM):  yea that's pretty cute i must admit
meg (2:10:39 PM):  ahahha
george (2:10:40 PM):  lol
meg (2:10:48 PM):  whenever i'm having a bad day that makes me feel better
vincent (2:10:54 PM):  do you guys know cuteoverload.com?
mara (2:11:00 PM):  lol
meg (2:11:03 PM):  yeah
amy (2:11:05 PM):  no
meg (2:11:08 PM):  haha
vincent (2:11:10 PM):  the name says it all
meg (2:11:27 PM):  i think the lol cats are really funny
meg (2:11:39 PM):  i can totally see my cat doing all those things
mara (2:11:45 PM):  yeah the kid ones are the best
meg (2:11:49 PM):  "i can has cheezburger?"
meg (2:12:17 PM):  there's some terrible things on youtube though
vincent (2:12:24 PM):  link
vincent (2:12:27 PM):  here's a good start
meg (2:12:30 PM):  like there's been some videos with animal torture....
amy (2:12:44 PM):  omg
meg (2:13:10 PM):  AWWW
mara (2:13:29 PM):  i like the one with the baby that says shit
mara (2:13:30 PM):  lol
meg (2:13:45 PM):  i like how we were talking about technology and now cute pictures of animals and babies
vincent (2:13:57 PM):  ha!
amy (2:14:00 PM):  lol
meg (2:14:08 PM):  the Ewok is cute
amy (2:14:16 PM):  but we never would have seen it had it not een for the tech.  lol
george (2:14:25 PM):  we're using techology to show each other cuteness
amy (2:14:33 PM):  i had a class in 7th grade called technology
amy (2:14:41 PM):  but it was really about building things out of wood  LOL
meg (2:15:03 PM):  we made little rockets in our tech class
george (2:15:06 PM):  the technology of wood
vincent (2:15:12 PM):  me too!  technology!  i never thought of that...
mara (2:15:14 PM):  george... is that cuteness universal
amy (2:15:16 PM):  i wonder what they do in there now
meg (2:15:43 PM):  prob the same thign
george (2:15:46 PM):  i think cuteness is relative
vincent (2:15:48 PM):  there are opposing tides of cuteness and darkness... an epic internet battle
amy (2:16:05 PM):  hopefully not-  or maybe its even called something different now
meg (2:16:16 PM):  shop class?
george (2:16:25 PM):  perhaps to some superstitious zulu tribe member, that puppy would appear to be some ferocious mythical beast
mara (2:16:38 PM):  i love it when there are a lot of people in this chat it works better
amy (2:16:39 PM):  i'll have to ask my teacher friends whats going on there these days
meg (2:16:40 PM):  hahaha i doubt that
amy (2:16:54 PM):  its tought to keep up though!  ; )
vincent (2:16:57 PM):  yeah!  better than when it was just the 2 of us.
meg (2:17:01 PM):  its true
george (2:17:09 PM):  5 people who don't personally know each other can be chaotic at times too
mara (2:17:16 PM):  yeah it is,... but it makes it much faster
amy (2:17:18 PM):  my mind is spinning (in a good way)
meg (2:17:41 PM):  i need more coffee
meg (2:17:42 PM):  hahaha
amy (2:17:47 PM):  and i wro down a bunch of new websites to go investigagte and find this puppy whistl!
mara (2:17:51 PM):  yeah but it makes things work faster ya know
vincent (2:17:56 PM):  the strange part, to me, is the idea of  a discussion leader... that never really happens on the internet
meg (2:18:15 PM):  that's true
amy (2:18:19 PM):  did i really help lead though?
meg (2:18:20 PM):  kind of
meg (2:18:28 PM):  sometimes people dominate the convo
meg (2:18:29 PM):  yeah
vincent (2:18:33 PM):  yeah, you got it rolling, for usre
vincent (2:18:34 PM):  sure
mara (2:18:34 PM):  yeah i think so ... you posed some questions that got us thinking
mara (2:18:36 PM):  ya know
amy (2:18:38 PM):  i think all our topics helped lead to new areas of the topic
meg (2:18:38 PM):  good question
meg (2:18:47 PM):  technology is REALLY ever present
george (2:18:48 PM):  i'm not sure people who don't know each other chat this long in general, too
amy (2:18:50 PM):  <bow>   thanks
mara (2:19:36 PM):  yeah but i never met you before meg
vincent (2:19:41 PM):  yeah, that's true, most chats must be like, 10 minutes or something?  what do you think the average is?
mara (2:19:42 PM):  everyone else i am familiar with
meg (2:19:46 PM):  its funny thinking about it, chat rooms in AOL and how they were the big thing... this is my first one
amy (2:19:52 PM):  i guess if there is a topic people can, but in what chat room do people Need to stay on the topic?
george (2:19:55 PM):  i'm so used to and dependent on technology, that comparing it to not having the tech was difficult!
meg (2:20:08 PM):  i was supposed to get on thurs but my wireless was too slow
vincent (2:20:28 PM):  not any, really.  even when you go to the chatroom for one specific thing, I bet the conversation is mostly about something else
mara (2:20:29 PM):  understandable
amy (2:20:45 PM):  i remember aol chat-  that was the first of the kind mostr likely
meg (2:21:02 PM):  lol when technology fails! i tried for like an hour to load this chat
vincent (2:21:05 PM):  i used to go crazy on AOL as a kid, I would stay up all night
meg (2:21:12 PM):  i loved aol
meg (2:21:23 PM):  now i am so glad i dont use it anymore
meg (2:21:31 PM):  it takes over computers
meg (2:21:36 PM):  with all the extra stuff
vincent (2:21:42 PM):  yeah, I just do google chat, with real friends, one at  a time.
amy (2:21:55 PM):  aol was fun to read throuhg profiles of people at your school...the orignal facebook!
george (2:22:05 PM):  yahoo has a voice chat people all over the world log into; that was interesting for a while
mara (2:22:14 PM):  does anyone use ratemyprofessor.com?
amy (2:22:24 PM):  no, but heard of it
meg (2:22:36 PM):  i like to look at it but i've never made a rate
vincent (2:22:37 PM):  i never have... but I looked up my friend who's a teacher, and some kids called him "hot"!
amy (2:22:51 PM):  lol
mara (2:22:58 PM):  lol
meg (2:23:03 PM):  hahaha, i always think its funny when people are lik that teacher has 5 tamales for hotness
vincent (2:23:16 PM):  so funny
meg (2:23:33 PM):  its cool that they use little peppers haahha
amy (2:23:35 PM):  i like going online to find out ratings on products and hotels
george (2:23:35 PM):  tamales!?
mara (2:23:47 PM):  i used it once, and i dont think i will ever again!  I got an email from a teacher once about the ratings he recieved on that site and he was hurt by them
george (2:23:47 PM):  lol
amy (2:23:51 PM):  i dont trust other people justgment in other people too often  lol
meg (2:24:00 PM):  oh yeah
mara (2:24:03 PM):  and i thought he was a good teacher so i nver read that crap anymore
vincent (2:24:16 PM):  I was just in Oakland, where Yelp is from (or maybe they're from San Fran), and I guess Yelp has been trying to manipulate businesses down there
amy (2:24:31 PM):  was someones chat line deleted?
meg (2:24:35 PM):  whats Yelp?
mara (2:24:44 PM):  well it was nice chatting with you guys i need to get the company i have here!
vincent (2:24:45 PM):  like, if they advertise, then Yelp will move their bad reviews further down the page
mara (2:24:52 PM):  ill tty all again soon! have a nice day.
meg (2:25:03 PM):  bye!
amy (2:25:03 PM):  see ya !
vincent (2:25:07 PM):  it's like you can look up reviews of restaurants, etc., rated by anonymous people who go there
meg (2:25:12 PM):  do we have a  topic for next week?
vincent (2:25:19 PM):  cool, bye folks!
george (2:25:24 PM):  yup, nice talking with you all

melany (10:03:25 AM):  Ok, We'll start with Penny.
melany (10:03:30 AM):  What did everyone think of her?
lynn (10:04:31 AM):  she was alright. she is not a native new yorker, so she may not be as familiar with the area as some other native ny residents
melany (10:04:41 AM):  that's a good point
melany (10:05:03 AM):  she seems to be responsible with pet sitting and child care experience
lynn (10:06:10 AM):  yes
melany (10:07:08 AM):  also big brothers and big sisters shows she works well with others
lynn (10:07:10 AM):  she did not put that she specifically wanted an ra position, not that that's a big deal, but the others did
melany (10:07:21 AM):  oh i didnt notice that
melany (10:07:25 AM):  thats very important
melany (10:07:50 AM):  she seems like a so-so candidate

melany (10:09:15 AM):  i dont have that on mine

ariel (10:10:38 AM):  she has some interesting skills lol
lynn (10:10:50 AM):  she doesn't have a lot of job experience
judith (10:10:54 AM):  i feel that that is a big part of being an RA is getting people to cooperate and coopating with others
judith (10:11:00 AM):  yea, her soldering experience is interesting lol
melany (10:11:07 AM):  yeah i wonder why she didnt state specific experiences related to those abilities though
luke (10:11:34 AM):  She seems like an alright candidate but nothing sticks out really
ted (10:11:54 AM):  she seems a hard worker
melany (10:11:56 AM):  i mean she can obviously handle alot being the owner of a lawn care service
melany (10:11:59 AM):  thats interesting
melany (10:12:03 AM):  she seems better than Penny
ted (10:12:09 AM):  i agree
ariel (10:12:09 AM):  being good door to door means being good wit ppl
luke (10:12:40 AM):  true
judith (10:12:44 AM):  and shes obvioulsy worked in a lot of group situations such as volleyball team and dram aclub
melany (10:12:44 AM):  she's fluent in german
melany (10:12:52 AM):  that could come in handy with international students haha
ariel (10:13:05 AM):  she said 100% customer return for the next year
ariel (10:13:13 AM):  i dont know i find that a bit hard to believe
lynn (10:13:35 AM):  she seems more like a business person than an ra to me
melany (10:13:40 AM):  yeah maybe she only has a few customers
melany (10:13:41 AM):  ahaha
melany (10:13:43 AM):  yeah
luke (10:13:48 AM):  lol that could be true as well
melany (10:14:23 AM):  she seems business-esque
ted (10:14:28 AM):  but that is why she wants to be an RA
ted (10:14:45 AM):  it pays for her room and board
lynn (10:14:47 AM):  yes, but she seems more self-interestesd than in helping others
judith (10:14:49 AM):  thats true
melany (10:14:51 AM):  yeah she seems very interested in artistic stuff
ariel (10:14:56 AM):  business-esque is horrible its like pick a side and stick to it
judith (10:15:25 AM):  yea but being creative could be a good thing
melany (10:15:53 AM):  oh yeah definetly
lynn (10:16:01 AM):  are we talking about jade?
melany (10:16:02 AM):  i just dont see much interest in human services
melany (10:16:04 AM):  yeah
melany (10:16:12 AM):  or whatever being an RA is related too
ariel (10:16:14 AM):  i feel like if she is too wishy washy then thats a bad thing she is also going to have to stand her ground as an ra
melany (10:16:15 AM):  to(
judith (10:17:15 AM):  i dunno, i like her leadershership and teamwork
judith (10:17:28 AM):  she attended a youth leadership confered
melany (10:17:43 AM):  thats good
melany (10:17:51 AM):  leadership is the most important quality in an RA
melany (10:17:52 AM):  i think
luke (10:18:09 AM):  yeaaa it has a lot to do with it
ariel (10:18:14 AM):  yeah but i dislike the fact that she tries to present herself as business like but really doesnt pull through
lynn (10:18:18 AM):  leadership is good, but only if you are a good communicator
judith (10:18:33 AM):  thats true
ariel (10:18:38 AM):  i get a bad feeling about stuff like that
lynn (10:18:50 AM):  she is very scientific in her academic background, and she is a good business leader, but she doesn't seem to be interested in helping others
ariel (10:18:53 AM):  like the person could be two faced, or doesnt really have their heart in the matter
lynn (10:18:54 AM):  as much as the others
lynn (10:20:09 AM):  what about the next one?
melany (10:20:41 AM):  yes let's move on to ryan
melany (10:21:02 AM):  he only wants to be an RA at empire
luke (10:21:31 AM):  the only thing i see for him is the scholarship that looks pretty good
ariel (10:21:40 AM):  i like him
melany (10:21:57 AM):  what do you like about him ariel?
ted (10:22:08 AM):  being a life guard brings good experience in case of emergency
ariel (10:22:13 AM):  he seems well rounded
lynn (10:22:21 AM):  more so than jade, in my opinion
ariel (10:22:34 AM):  and you have to be good with people if your into newspapers and stuff
melany (10:22:45 AM):  yeah he seems more socially oriented than Jade
judith (10:22:48 AM):  its good hes a comm major too
ariel (10:22:51 AM):  and to teach them how to swim
melany (10:22:54 AM):  lifegaurding is clearly about helping people
judith (10:22:55 AM):  and marketing is a pretty creative field as well
ariel (10:22:58 AM):  yeah i agree
luke (10:23:16 AM):  shee i guess he does seem well rounded
ted (10:23:18 AM):  he might handle better cases when students get intoxicated
melany (10:23:36 AM):  i feel like he would be easily accessible, easy to talk to
ariel (10:23:39 AM):  yeah which we know happends alot freshmen year
ted (10:23:58 AM):  i like this guy
luke (10:24:19 AM):  do u guys think hes better than the first 2 we went over?
lynn (10:24:19 AM):  is this ra position specifically for this dorm, though/
ted (10:24:22 AM):  but the fact that he wants to work on empire
melany (10:24:40 AM):  thats weird
lynn (10:24:40 AM):  he seems better to me than jade
lynn (10:24:51 AM):  for an ra position
ted (10:25:21 AM):  he knows he is qualified that is why he wnats to be an ra in empire
ted (10:25:39 AM):  but that shows that he is not into helping but just into himself
judith (10:25:41 AM):  maybe he wants to live on empire
judith (10:25:48 AM):  so thats why is being specific
judith (10:26:00 AM):  he probably doesnt think living in one of the quads is worth the positiion
melany (10:26:07 AM):  i guess, i bet thats a high demand job
judith (10:26:09 AM):  or maybe he is confident in his abiltiies
luke (10:26:11 AM):  yeaa or he doesnt want to be bothered with freshman and sophmores lol
ted (10:26:26 AM):  there are not freshman in empire
ted (10:26:36 AM):  he is needed more in another dorms
melany (10:26:38 AM):  yeah
luke (10:26:57 AM):  yeaa thats why i said maybe thats why he wanted to do empire
ted (10:27:03 AM):  i will hire him and assign him to indian
lynn (10:27:34 AM):  that's just mean
ariel (10:27:36 AM):  it could be as simple as he likes empire better
melany (10:27:36 AM):  haha he would be mad
melany (10:27:41 AM):  he may not accept it
ariel (10:27:48 AM):  and the atmosphere suits him better
ariel (10:27:57 AM):  like for studying, or the freedom
ariel (10:27:59 AM):  who knows
luke (10:28:12 AM):  maybe
lynn (10:28:29 AM):  sorry....
lynn (10:28:47 AM):  i meant to say, i think i liked evan better
judith (10:29:40 AM):  yea, honestly as someone older i wouldnt want to be an RA on one of the quads
judith (10:29:45 AM):  but empire could be cool
ariel (10:30:42 AM):  eh... he is ok... spanish, cpr and first aid give him some props in my book but he doesnt seem as well rounded
melany (10:31:07 AM):  what do we think of evan?
lynn (10:31:15 AM):  he doesn't seem as narrow as far as ryan did in choice of where he ra's
melany (10:31:23 AM):  he took a public speaking course which is good
ted (10:31:24 AM):  i like his objective
lynn (10:31:52 AM):  i also liked that he worked at the bookstore, so he knows the campus pretty well and textbooks, etc.
lynn (10:31:57 AM):  that could be good for new students in the dorm
luke (10:31:58 AM):  yeaa hes more flexible hed work any of the sports they put him
ariel (10:32:01 AM):  i dont like him as much as Ryan
ted (10:32:07 AM):  that statement tells me that he wants to do some work and also get experience while doing it
judith (10:32:08 AM):  i dunno, im not that impressed
judith (10:32:14 AM):  nothing is sticking out very much to me
melany (10:32:16 AM):  thats a really strong objective
ted (10:32:17 AM):  very down to earth statement
luke (10:32:20 AM):  yea me neither
lynn (10:32:43 AM):  why?
ariel (10:32:53 AM):  the objective just sounds to me like a token look good statement
lynn (10:33:08 AM):  but he understands that those skills are important for an ra, which they are
lynn (10:33:16 AM):  better than just being in empire
ariel (10:33:18 AM):  yeah.. i guess
ted (10:33:33 AM):  exactly good point lynn
judith (10:33:43 AM):  i mean, i guess its good he did debate because there is logic and reasoning involved and his objective is good
melany (10:33:51 AM):  thats a good point lynn
lynn (10:33:55 AM):  he's going to ahve to settle disputes as an ra, too
lynn (10:34:09 AM):  possibly
ariel (10:34:24 AM):  can someone explain his address a bit
melany (10:34:26 AM):  hes a member of a business professional of america
ariel (10:34:26 AM):  im confused
melany (10:34:38 AM):  its good to be professional
lynn (10:34:43 AM):  she's from idaho
ariel (10:34:43 AM):  so? im a memeber of the price chopper saving club
judith (10:34:48 AM):  lol ditto
ariel (10:34:50 AM):  i dont think that makes a difference
luke (10:35:00 AM):  i guess he out his home address wheres hes originally from and not the one on campus
ariel (10:35:26 AM):  i dun know the Moscow is confusing
lynn (10:35:29 AM):  sorry, i meant *he's* from idaho
ariel (10:35:29 AM):  w/e
judith (10:35:49 AM):  yea he might not know the area
ariel (10:36:22 AM):  i just feel like he is very superficial
melany (10:36:34 AM):  all resumes are superficial thought
ted (10:36:36 AM):  it will be better if he was from new york
melany (10:36:39 AM):  though*
ariel (10:36:43 AM):  we need someone real, because being an RA is not like dealing with public speaking or business deals
ariel (10:36:59 AM):  this guy seems to business suit, cut and dry
ariel (10:37:21 AM):  nothing tells me he could deal with everyday life, like if a student got drunk really bad and needed to talk to someone in the morning
ted (10:37:24 AM):  i dont agree with ariel
melany (10:37:31 AM):  me either
lynn (10:37:52 AM):  which candidate do you feel is better at handling "everyday life" situations?
ariel (10:38:37 AM):  probably penny and ryan
judith (10:38:44 AM):  yea penny looked good
melany (10:39:01 AM):  what about sandra?
ariel (10:39:11 AM):  i havent looked at her yet
lynn (10:39:17 AM):  she seemed good, too
luke (10:39:24 AM):  yea
ariel (10:39:26 AM):  i thought u were the one that suggested we go in order
ariel (10:39:38 AM):  now your including people we have not covered
lynn (10:39:42 AM):  she worked as a camp counselor
lynn (10:39:49 AM):  which is good, for this position, i think
melany (10:40:01 AM):  sandra is next in order
lynn (10:40:04 AM):  sandra is the next person
judith (10:40:07 AM):  should we discuss sandra?
melany (10:40:27 AM):  yes
luke (10:40:39 AM):  yea
lynn (10:40:41 AM):  her camp counselor experience would be useful
melany (10:41:08 AM):  she doesnt have her college GPA
judith (10:41:10 AM):  and she used to be involved in outreach which is good
lynn (10:41:32 AM):  that's true, she doesn't list her gpa
melany (10:41:36 AM):  which we would need but i guess you could eventually find it out
lynn (10:41:36 AM):  for college
lynn (10:42:14 AM):  right, kind of curious that she listed it for high school and not college, though
melany (10:42:16 AM):  maybe her GPA isnt that string
melany (10:42:19 AM):  strong*
melany (10:42:21 AM):  for college
judith (10:42:25 AM):  i dont think thats that important
melany (10:42:32 AM):  as long as its above a 2.5
luke (10:42:38 AM):  yea i would think its atleas the minimum if shes applying
lynn (10:42:38 AM):  it's not really, except that there is a minimum required
melany (10:42:41 AM):  which is what is said is required
ted (10:42:46 AM):  she seemed to be very involved in activities during high school, but not as much during college
melany (10:42:55 AM):  yeah i think someone could not have a gpa and still be a great RA
ariel (10:43:05 AM):  i think so too
ariel (10:43:10 AM):  numbers arent everything
ariel (10:43:17 AM):  brb door
lynn (10:43:40 AM):  yes, i agree, but if it's a requirement, we have to abide by that as the hiring people, unless we change that requirement
judith (10:44:18 AM):  true i didnt know it was a requirement
luke (10:44:37 AM):  yea i guess theres not much we could really d o to find out
melany (10:44:41 AM):  i like that she participated in outreach programs
melany (10:44:47 AM):  through her church
lynn (10:44:53 AM):  she does seem interested in others
judith (10:45:22 AM):  yea i like her
melany (10:46:01 AM):  she seems like a good candidate
lynn (10:46:06 AM):  i like her, too
lynn (10:46:30 AM):  she's has a lot of psychology courses, ,which could be handy
melany (10:46:36 AM):  she's from PA so she could be assuring to those not from NY
lynn (10:46:52 AM):  that's a good point
ted (10:46:52 AM):  it seems she watns to help, not necesarily just looking at the free room
melany (10:46:55 AM):  and she knows of activities and how to organize them
melany (10:47:04 AM):  from her camp counselor experience
luke (10:47:17 AM):  yeaa that could help
lynn (10:48:13 AM):  can we eliminate anybody from consideration to start narrowing down?
ted (10:48:24 AM):  ok
melany (10:49:00 AM):  penny---keep or eliminate?
lynn (10:49:22 AM):  i'd vote for keep for now, though she wasn't my top choice
judith (10:49:32 AM):  i feel like they were all okayt...nobody stood out as amazing or horrible to me
melany (10:49:38 AM):  i know its hard to eliminate
luke (10:49:55 AM):  yeaa this ones tough i dont think that anyone is really taht much better than the others
melany (10:50:11 AM):  yeah hmm
lynn (10:50:37 AM):  i'd vote to eliminate jade at this point
lynn (10:50:56 AM):  just to start narrowing down
lynn (10:51:22 AM):  she's definitely smart, but i don't see that she has the people skills that others do
judith (10:52:00 AM):  i agree
ariel (10:52:07 AM):  yep i agree as well
judith (10:52:07 AM):  we have to eliminate someone lol
melany (10:52:27 AM):  i agree
ted (10:52:36 AM):  it is difficult to eliminate they all have similar pros and cons
judith (10:52:43 AM):  yea lol
ted (10:52:45 AM):  i can tell you i like evan though
luke (10:52:51 AM):  well i didnt think ryan had anything about him that he stood out
judith (10:52:52 AM):  yea i liked evan as well
lynn (10:53:05 AM):  i actually think evan is my top choice
ted (10:53:19 AM):  i did not like the guy that applied only for empire
ted (10:53:32 AM):  those are my two cents
melany (10:54:13 AM):  i didnt like evan that much
lynn (10:54:14 AM):  yes, that's ryan
melany (10:54:15 AM):  me either
luke (10:54:18 AM):  soo it kind of looks liek ryan is the weakest one so far
melany (10:54:21 AM):  ryan and evan r eliminated in my mind
ariel (10:54:52 AM):  my best vote is for Sandra
ted (10:55:03 AM):  melany, could you explain please?
melany (10:55:32 AM):  well ryan only wanted to be an RA at empire
melany (10:55:34 AM):  so that turned me off
lynn (10:55:38 AM):  me too
judith (10:55:43 AM):  i actually liked that
ted (10:55:44 AM):  agrreed
judith (10:55:45 AM):  it showed confidence
ariel (10:55:52 AM):  me too
judith (10:55:54 AM):  and not like he was just desperate to save money
ariel (10:56:07 AM):  true!
lynn (10:56:14 AM):  what didn't you like about evan, melany?
ariel (10:56:33 AM):  wow judith i had never even thought about that
melany (10:56:56 AM):  umm i think i would actually keep evan now that im looking @ his resume again
melany (10:57:04 AM):  spanish proficiency is good
lynn (10:57:14 AM):  but he wants free room and board at the most expensive dorm on campus, and ONLY there
lynn (10:57:21 AM):  yes, i liked the spanish proficiency too
lynn (10:57:28 AM):  and cpr experience
melany (10:57:31 AM):  yeah he obviously has alterior motives
judith (10:57:55 AM):  yea but that means he has enough confidence to get that room
judith (10:58:04 AM):  and his resume isnt some cut and paste document he sends out everywhere
luke (10:58:05 AM):  soo is there one person we could drop?
judith (10:58:10 AM):  he tailored it for the position which i like
ted (10:58:25 AM):  which is what i dont like
ted (10:58:43 AM):  about rich ddadys boy ryan
lynn (10:58:43 AM):  i think, luke, that we agreed to drop jade
melany (10:58:56 AM):  yes
judith (10:59:06 AM):  i think thats a smart move...if you send out the same resume to everyone u didnt take the time to think about the position
ariel (10:59:11 AM):  yeah but the fact that he has enough confidence and a voice to state his mind means he would do the same as an RA
luke (10:59:12 AM):  ookk thanks
lynn (10:59:22 AM):  but is the position specifically for empire?
melany (11:00:21 AM):  i dont believe so
ariel (11:00:28 AM):  no its not
lynn (11:00:44 AM):  he's choosing that himself, and in my opinion, he's taking his own liberties
ariel (11:01:01 AM):  but btw its not free for him to live on campus because he is an RA btw
ariel (11:01:15 AM):  its just a discount essentially
lynn (11:01:25 AM):  yes, i do realize that, but he wouldn't have to pay a very expensive room and board
ariel (11:01:40 AM):  anyway you cut it empire is expensive
ariel (11:01:45 AM):  i dont care discount or not
luke (11:01:47 AM):  yeaa it is
judith (11:01:50 AM):  true
ariel (11:01:52 AM):  i definatly dont have the money for it
ariel (11:02:26 AM):  i dont agree, yes he took a liberty but he also too an action
ted (11:02:31 AM):  neither does ryan
lynn (11:02:43 AM):  which is why if you could live there for free (or at a greatly reduced discount), it would be great. i agree with melany, it's an ulterior motive. at least he's being honest about it, htough
ariel (11:02:44 AM):  which is more then i can say for most people who just walk past things that happen in the dorms
judith (11:03:14 AM):  i like the confidence
melany (11:03:17 AM):  yeah at least hes being honest and straighforward
ariel (11:03:18 AM):  me too
ariel (11:03:38 AM):  besides whos to say if offered he wouldnt decide to take one of the other postitions
lynn (11:03:47 AM):  which is why i feel comfortable being straightforward in taking him out of consideration
luke (11:03:50 AM):  yeaa i guess u really never know
ariel (11:03:52 AM):  people aply for one job all the time and get hired by the same people to do something else
melany (11:04:14 AM):  maybe he thought u had to be specific
ted (11:04:18 AM):  what other positions you are talking about/
ariel (11:04:49 AM):  like if he thought u had to be specific as melany said
ariel (11:05:05 AM):  and yet was given a different spot then he choose
lynn (11:05:19 AM):  but that means he didn't read the job description very carefully
ted (11:05:32 AM):  he had something in mid
ted (11:05:38 AM):  mind sorry
melany (11:05:56 AM):  hmmm what a predicament
melany (11:06:08 AM):  its difficult to pinpoint what his intentions are
ted (11:06:25 AM):  he wanted empire specificallly
ariel (11:06:30 AM):  so you think he didnt read the job discription? what if he was just taking a liberty? and he did read it well
ariel (11:06:54 AM):  i mean hell suny needs to have RA's for everywhere
lynn (11:06:57 AM):  but then why would he specify? that's narrowing him down to the search committee
ariel (11:07:06 AM):  i dont see why taking him based on empire is a bad choice
judith (11:07:24 AM):  yea me neither
luke (11:07:24 AM):  i think that we need to just base it off their qualifications because we could talk about his intentions all we want to but we are never really going to know what it was based upon...
lynn (11:07:28 AM):  but why is it a good choice?
ariel (11:07:43 AM):  because i think he speaks his mind
ted (11:07:51 AM):  we ar trying to eliminate people and he is the next on my list
ariel (11:07:53 AM):  and i think that's the best for an RA
ted (11:08:10 AM):  not always
lynn (11:08:11 AM):  i don't agree that speaking your mind is best for an ra. you need to listen as an ra, not dictate
judith (11:09:13 AM):  i think u need both
ariel (11:09:20 AM):  sure this is true but i think his listening skills are implied from the other things on his resume
ted (11:09:51 AM):  we;; tjos doscissopms os mpt abpit pm;u ruam
judith (11:09:55 AM):  ??!
judith (11:09:56 AM):  lol
judith (11:09:57 AM):  what
luke (11:09:58 AM):  lol
ariel (11:10:07 AM):  was that english?
lynn (11:10:10 AM):  other people had good listening skills, and didn't narrow down their choice to one dorm only
lynn (11:10:15 AM):  lol....
ariel (11:10:24 AM):  lol your funny
ariel (11:10:27 AM):  but still
ted (11:10:32 AM):  sorry cat walked on my keyboard
judith (11:10:36 AM):  LOL
judith (11:10:40 AM):  im literally laughing out loud lol
lynn (11:10:49 AM):  why is the cat always the scapegoat??
lynn (11:10:51 AM):  lol
ariel (11:10:59 AM):  oh i see... ted thats why i have a spray bottle next to my computer
melany (11:11:14 AM):  hahahhaha
lynn (11:11:15 AM):  poor kitty...
ted (11:11:22 AM):  haha
melany (11:11:34 AM):  thats funy
melany (11:11:36 AM):  funny*
melany (11:12:02 AM):  so we need to start narrowing down and make a decision
ariel (11:12:03 AM):  poor kitty? i love my kitten... i feed her... i pet her... and i cuddle with her every night
melany (11:12:07 AM):  does anyone have a favorite?
ariel (11:12:15 AM):  but seriously for all that she cant stay off my key borad
ariel (11:12:17 AM):  *board
lynn (11:12:20 AM):  no, i know, i love my kitty too, but the spraying i meant....
ariel (11:12:28 AM):  sorry kitty's gotta get wet
lynn (11:12:40 AM):  yes, they sometimes do have to get wet

irene (20:02:22 PM):  hi
vicky (20:02:27 PM):  Hello
vicky (20:02:45 PM):  waiting for more people?
irene (20:02:50 PM):  i guess
moderator (20:04:17 PM):  Great!
moderator (20:04:24 PM):  You guys may begin.
irene (20:04:25 PM):  hi
luke (20:04:29 PM):  hello
melany (20:04:32 PM):  hi everyone
moderator (20:04:33 PM):  rita, could you please lead today.
moderator (20:04:57 PM):  You simply have to ensure that the discussion stays on track and that you (as a group) reach a consensus at the end.
melany (20:05:03 PM):  does group b have a diff topic from group a?
melany (20:05:09 PM):  i was originally assigned to group a
irene (20:05:16 PM):  yeah me too melany
melany (20:05:35 PM):  can someone please provide us with a link to the topic?
moderator (20:05:38 PM):  Nope, same topic
melany (20:05:42 PM):  ok thanks!
rita (20:05:48 PM):  link
irene (20:06:03 PM):  we are group b
irene (20:06:06 PM):  link
rita (20:06:10 PM):  Opps
rita (20:06:20 PM):  I can't even spell tonight!
rita (20:06:31 PM):  Thanks irene
moderator (20:07:12 PM):  So what do say rita?
moderator (20:07:22 PM):  Will you be able to lead tonight?
rita (20:07:28 PM):  Sure
moderator (20:07:49 PM):  Great, you may begin now, guys! :-)
vicky (20:08:57 PM):  don't everybody jump in at once
rita (20:08:59 PM):  So the task is to use the criteria at the bottom to pick one of the 5 listed choices
luke (20:08:59 PM):  well to start off I think the science one looked the best
irene (20:09:00 PM):  hahah
irene (20:09:21 PM):  yeah i figured science or geography
melany (20:09:24 PM):  i liked the marine life one just because i think it would be the most visually entertaining
luke (20:09:42 PM):  yeaa i think they would all be pretty cool
luke (20:09:49 PM):  well except the museum lol
rita (20:09:53 PM):  My first thought was the Geography one was the most transferable for the Boogle company
melany (20:09:56 PM):  yea the museum seemed boring
vicky (20:10:13 PM):  kids science museums tend to have games though
melany (20:10:14 PM):  geography would probably easy to teach
vicky (20:10:17 PM):  and interesting exhibits
vicky (20:10:30 PM):  maybe the exhibits could be made into flash games
melany (20:10:51 PM):  which does everyone think wouild be the easiest to teach?
irene (20:11:08 PM):  i think geography would be good to look at in 3d
rita (20:11:09 PM):  Different schools cover different topics in science at different points in the year and at different grades but every class should be working on at least one geopgraphy topic at any given time
irene (20:11:15 PM):  true
luke (20:11:16 PM):  well the easiest i would say the wild life cause kids like animals
irene (20:11:18 PM):  but they should have all topics
irene (20:11:22 PM):  they shouldn't ignore any topics
irene (20:11:25 PM):  even art is important
irene (20:11:28 PM):  you have to expose kids to everything
melany (20:11:45 PM):  i think wild life as well luke, animals are very entrertaining to kids
melany (20:11:48 PM):  entertaining*
irene (20:11:56 PM):  yeah they're already entertaining
irene (20:12:00 PM):  we should pick the most boring topic
melany (20:12:01 PM):  i think they should have an all topic program
irene (20:12:04 PM):  because in 3d it would just make it cool
melany (20:12:10 PM):  yeah thats very true
melany (20:12:24 PM):  i saw a mummy 3d educational film and it made somehting boring really interesting
vicky (20:12:50 PM):  maybe we can focus on a topic that isn't traditionally fun to learn, melany
vicky (20:13:01 PM):  I like the idea of using an alternative teaching method to interest kids that otherwise wouldn't be
melany (20:13:02 PM):  yeah i think thats a good idea
luke (20:13:11 PM):  I also think earth would give the most information to the kids because you can learn geography, different climates and the different hemispheres like that
irene (20:13:12 PM):  yeah i think we should do that
irene (20:13:24 PM):  i think it would be cool to see the world geography in 3d
vicky (20:13:25 PM):  so we can give our opinions on what topic is most boring haha
irene (20:13:28 PM):  yeah
melany (20:13:37 PM):  yeah we should decide which topic is the most boring
luke (20:13:47 PM):  id say the tour of a museum would be so the first 2
rita (20:13:49 PM):  I am checking the new york state education standards ... is anyone familiar with what is tested in fifth grade?
melany (20:14:18 PM):  i think the historical museum for sure
irene (20:14:28 PM):  not really, i forgot what the requirements are
irene (20:14:34 PM):  but they do need to be well-rounded
rita (20:15:01 PM):  In Washington State the kids where tested in 2nd, 4th, and 5th grade (that's were I came from)
melany (20:15:22 PM):  i think i was tested in 5th grade as well
irene (20:15:32 PM):  yeah we probably were
irene (20:15:34 PM):  it depends on hte state
vicky (20:15:55 PM):  looks like 5th grade is english, math and social studies
melany (20:16:00 PM):  overall, in 5th grade you need to have good overall education ya know
vicky (20:16:04 PM):  link
melany (20:16:07 PM):  every topic needs to be focused on
melany (20:16:14 PM):  hmm so history might be a good idea
melany (20:16:25 PM):  being that science isnt tested
rita (20:16:30 PM):  Thanks melany
irene (20:16:38 PM):  good point!
luke (20:16:41 PM):  yeaa
vicky (20:16:56 PM):  I would agree with the history museum
rita (20:17:00 PM):  I was thinking if the students had an exam in a certain subject in the fifth grade that would be a good choice
irene (20:17:04 PM):  yeah
melany (20:17:08 PM):  how do you think the experience should be?
vicky (20:17:10 PM):  it would be a nice break from cramming to play games or take an interactive tour or something on a computer
melany (20:17:13 PM):  like how should it be constructed?
melany (20:17:16 PM):  yeah i agree vicky
irene (20:17:33 PM):  i pictured it as putting on these goggles
irene (20:17:37 PM):  and having a virtual tour
irene (20:17:48 PM):  and then maybe some headphones
melany (20:17:49 PM):  would this be an in classroom experience?
irene (20:17:52 PM):  yeah
melany (20:17:56 PM):  that sounds fun
luke (20:18:44 PM):  so are there ones we can eliminate taht we wouldnt do
melany (20:18:55 PM):  yeah good idea luke
irene (20:19:32 PM):  maybe get rid of the animal ones
luke (20:19:34 PM):  well do u guys think we should do the most boring one to make it interesting or was that just an idea?
irene (20:19:37 PM):  because htey'd be interesting without the 3d
vicky (20:19:40 PM):  ... I'd eliminate everything but the history and geography since nothing else would be covered by the state exams
melany (20:19:45 PM):  i would eliminate the science because it isn't tested and geography somewhat relates to social studues
vicky (20:19:45 PM):  not that those topics aren't important
irene (20:19:52 PM):  i agree
luke (20:20:33 PM):  yea me too
luke (20:20:39 PM):  so that just leaves 2
melany (20:21:00 PM):  which would be the easiest for students to learn/use?
melany (20:21:04 PM):  thats part of the criteria
irene (20:21:06 PM):  yeah
irene (20:21:09 PM):  well
irene (20:21:10 PM):  it's not mandatory
irene (20:21:13 PM):  it's just suggestions
luke (20:21:19 PM):  i think the geography would because history is less visual learning
irene (20:21:25 PM):  yeah
vicky (20:21:25 PM):  I think ease of use depends more on the programmer than the topic
irene (20:21:27 PM):  i agree with luke
luke (20:21:32 PM):  it would be harder to learn certain facts
melany (20:22:00 PM):  depends on how indepth with geography the program was
luke (20:22:06 PM):  yea
rita (20:22:09 PM):  Both are very fact / memorization based....
luke (20:22:24 PM):  well i think it would be able to get across like the main facts..
rita (20:22:24 PM):  which students don't always enjoy.
vicky (20:22:35 PM):  I know I didn't
melany (20:22:48 PM):  i hated geography
melany (20:22:58 PM):  i took it in college as well and it was difficult
melany (20:23:15 PM):  but obviously they arent learning it on that level
melany (20:23:22 PM):  im assuming they would be learning continents and such?
melany (20:23:32 PM):  and different countries
luke (20:23:35 PM):  yeaa i figure nothing to advanced it is only 5th grade
rita (20:23:43 PM):  but would a virtual environment make it easier to relate for the students?
melany (20:24:06 PM):  i feel like geography is always learned the same way
melany (20:24:17 PM):  and its difficult to make it a unique learning experience
luke (20:24:44 PM):  yeaa its kind of like a set material.. in history they could choose different events and all that
melany (20:24:50 PM):  exactly
melany (20:24:56 PM):  history has a lot more room to develop
melany (20:25:05 PM):  based on whatever the regents material consists of
vicky (20:25:24 PM):  it looks like the test is reading for content, looking at diagrams and graphs
irene (20:25:25 PM):  they're called regents at that age?
vicky (20:25:33 PM):  I'm checking out a sample 2009 exam
melany (20:25:55 PM):  i'm not sure, i was just going by the weblink someone posted haha
vicky (20:26:10 PM):  the board of regents oversees education in NY
vicky (20:26:17 PM):  but I'm not sure if the exam is called a regents
luke (20:26:31 PM):  i dont really remember either
melany (20:26:33 PM):  i dont think it is
melany (20:26:41 PM):  because i remember taking regents in HS
irene (20:26:57 PM):  yeah
vicky (20:26:58 PM):  wow
irene (20:26:58 PM):  me too
melany (20:27:16 PM):  how does the exam look vicky?
vicky (20:27:16 PM):  at least in the 20009 test they didn't care about memorization
vicky (20:27:25 PM):  it's all dbq's and reading for content, basically
melany (20:27:31 PM):  ohhhh DBQs
melany (20:27:34 PM):  i remember those
irene (20:27:51 PM):  i hated dbq's!!
irene (20:27:58 PM):  i thought that was high school too
luke (20:27:59 PM):  I think its just NYS exam
vicky (20:28:06 PM):  they really pounded them in during class
melany (20:28:08 PM):  they def had them in HS
vicky (20:28:13 PM):  I think I'd avoid MORE dbq's in the software
melany (20:28:18 PM):  i liked how you could kind of BS through them tho sometimes
vicky (20:28:23 PM):  but reading for content is good
melany (20:28:33 PM):  as long as you had basic knowledge of the subject
vicky (20:28:51 PM):  there are some sample test here if anyone is interested: link
irene (20:29:02 PM):  cool
rita (20:29:07 PM):  thanks for the link.
vicky (20:29:12 PM):  not a problem
melany (20:29:12 PM):  thanks!
vicky (20:30:18 PM):  will brb
melany (20:30:31 PM):  i think the wildlife would be interesting but not substational to 5th grade learning
melany (20:30:39 PM):  i took marine biology in HS as an elective
melany (20:30:47 PM):  it's kind of like a personal interest type of thing
luke (20:30:50 PM):  my computer sucks and wont load it lol
melany (20:30:59 PM):  mine too haha
luke (20:31:31 PM):  hmm o well
irene (20:31:54 PM):  i think it would be substaintial to their learning
irene (20:31:58 PM):  but we should focus on the boring stuff
irene (20:32:04 PM):  and what they're being tested on
melany (20:32:25 PM):  yeah like i feel like they would find it interesting but they wouldnt need the information til later in schooling
luke (20:33:55 PM):  yea thats trues
luke (20:33:57 PM):  true*
vicky (20:34:26 PM):  well since reading comprehension is important
vicky (20:34:38 PM):  maybe it could be a self-selected topic within social studies
melany (20:34:46 PM):  yeah thats a good idea
vicky (20:34:47 PM):  they play a game, read a paragraph, explore a few links
vicky (20:34:53 PM):  answer some questions based on what they learned
melany (20:34:55 PM):  i dont even remember what i learned in 5th grade SS
vicky (20:35:05 PM):  if they actually get to pick what they learn about (within reason) maybe it would be more satisfying
luke (20:35:17 PM):  i just remember like the civil war i think lol
luke (20:35:23 PM):  revolutionary
irene (20:35:36 PM):  that's why there's the show are you smarter than a fifth grader
luke (20:35:36 PM):  christopher columbus
melany (20:35:46 PM):  they should pick topics that they have the most difficulty understanding
melany (20:35:50 PM):  visuals usually help with that
luke (20:36:48 PM):  yeaa d o u guys have any ideas what it wold
vicky (20:37:07 PM):  ?
luke (20:37:26 PM):  sorry that wasnt very clear haha i mean like subjects that would be hard to learn
vicky (20:37:37 PM):  oh I see
melany (20:37:55 PM):  hmm
melany (20:38:10 PM):  i always found geography difficult but thats a whole other topic
melany (20:38:21 PM):  i guess remembering specific war information?
melany (20:38:24 PM):  like who fought who?
luke (20:38:27 PM):  yeaa and some names
melany (20:38:29 PM):  was that relevant at that age?
irene (20:38:31 PM):  i feel like history is easier
luke (20:38:33 PM):  i think so
vicky (20:38:34 PM):  that type of information isn't on the exams though
irene (20:38:36 PM):  geography is the hardest and most boring
vicky (20:38:38 PM):  at least not for 5th grade
melany (20:38:41 PM):  yeah i remember doing like explorers and such
rita (20:38:59 PM):  so how would visualization help with names and dates
melany (20:39:17 PM):  i can only think of images of the person and the accomplishment their associated with
irene (20:39:23 PM):  like geography has maps and stuff
melany (20:39:25 PM):  like christopher columbus
irene (20:39:28 PM):  and you need ot see them
irene (20:39:31 PM):  history is just memorizing
irene (20:39:33 PM):  for hte most part
rita (20:39:50 PM):  geography might work better if you could "explore" the locations
melany (20:39:54 PM):  thats why i felt geography wouild be a good topic to use for thus
vicky (20:40:06 PM):  I like that idea rita
luke (20:40:09 PM):  yeaa i think that would be the best one as well
vicky (20:40:16 PM):  a lot of the test questions showed examples of cultural artifacts
vicky (20:40:22 PM):  then asked kids content-based questions about them
vicky (20:40:27 PM):  maybe it could be a clickable globe
vicky (20:40:36 PM):  the child decides where to "travel" and learns about the culture?
vicky (20:40:47 PM):  and/or geography, wildlife, whatever
luke (20:40:47 PM):  yeaa thats a good idea
melany (20:40:55 PM):  thats interesting
luke (20:41:52 PM):  yea
melany (20:42:05 PM):  what images should be 3D?
melany (20:42:52 PM):  the whole thing or only select images?
irene (20:43:05 PM):  maps but like, 3d maps
luke (20:43:06 PM):  i think it would be better if the whole thing was to keep them interested
rita (20:43:33 PM):  My son got a Little Einsteins globe for Christmas this year and it is sooo cool
melany (20:43:34 PM):  or if it was sporatic you could keep them intrigued because they would be waiting for the next thing to pop out
melany (20:43:35 PM):  hahaha
melany (20:43:43 PM):  just because i know thats what im like with 3D movies
irene (20:44:06 PM):  yeah
irene (20:44:11 PM):  :)
luke (20:44:14 PM):  yupp
rita (20:44:15 PM):  It has a joy stick on the side and all these games you play to fly "rocket" to the different location high lighted on the globe
melany (20:44:30 PM):  that sounds fun
irene (20:44:41 PM):  cool
melany (20:44:57 PM):  would this program be expensive to make? who would it be available to?
irene (20:45:10 PM):  i think just the albany school
irene (20:45:15 PM):  and it's expensive but they're giving us money
rita (20:45:25 PM):  He just turned four - so he doesn't know the continents but they are different colors on the globe and he knows the Sphinx is on the ornge one. :-)
rita (20:45:32 PM):  *orange
irene (20:46:05 PM):  kids are smart
luke (20:46:32 PM):  yea i dont think it would be to expensive to develop something like that especially if it waas going to last for a while
rita (20:46:39 PM):  Well, the cool part with a geography program is you could start with five major points of interest and fill in with others over time
irene (20:46:46 PM):  yes
melany (20:46:51 PM):  oh alright, missed that part--sorry :)
irene (20:46:51 PM):  good point
melany (20:47:27 PM):  i definetly think the geography would be very useful
luke (20:47:38 PM):  yeaa i think they could do a lot more with it than history
vicky (20:48:02 PM):  it might be harder to make the history interactive
rita (20:48:10 PM):  Let's discuss the "Most important factor" "
rita (20:48:14 PM):  which program will have the most educational impact when compared to or augmented by traditional teaching methods?
vicky (20:48:15 PM):  which is what we all seem to be thinking the software should leans towards
rita (20:48:52 PM):  How do teachers traditionally teacher geography?
rita (20:49:07 PM):  In the third grade we did country reports - I had Jamaca
rita (20:49:43 PM):  In the sixth grade we did state reports and I had Maryland ... Do the rest of you remember stuff like that?
vicky (20:50:05 PM):  I remember the state report, but not the country
melany (20:50:12 PM):  i remember doing a report on Nigeria
irene (20:50:13 PM):  i have a bad memory :(
luke (20:50:13 PM):  i think it would have a good impact... it would be a lot more interesting than just studying maps and reading paragraphs about it
melany (20:50:18 PM):  i think it was like 4th grade tho
rita (20:50:22 PM):  Well, it was a poster and a little presentation
rita (20:50:45 PM):  By the sixth grade my state report was 10 to 15 typed pages
melany (20:50:46 PM):  yeah i had the same thing for nigeria
melany (20:50:55 PM):  and i did belgium
melany (20:50:57 PM):  as well
melany (20:51:01 PM):  very random but i remember haha
luke (20:51:22 PM):  i remember doing it as awell i just dont know what i had
irene (20:52:38 PM):  this is til 930 right
luke (20:52:44 PM):  yup
irene (20:52:47 PM):  k
rita (20:53:08 PM):  So ... now I am going to date myself ... we didn't have the internet so we wrote to the cambers of commerce for info on the state
rita (20:53:23 PM):  Now the kids use the internet
vicky (20:53:32 PM):  kids have internet in the womb now
vicky (20:53:33 PM):  it's wireless
melany (20:53:37 PM):  yeah everything is online now
rita (20:53:40 PM):  so an online 3-D research tool might be really cool
melany (20:53:42 PM):  did you ever hear of club penguin?
irene (20:53:50 PM):  no
melany (20:53:57 PM):  i tutored a girl in middle school and she was obsessed with it
irene (20:54:01 PM):  yeah i definitely think the 3d experience will engage the students
melany (20:54:09 PM):  it's like social networking for their age
melany (20:54:11 PM):  yeah i agree
luke (20:54:14 PM):  yeaa
melany (20:54:22 PM):  3d will make them absorb the information the best
irene (20:54:28 PM):  definitely
irene (20:54:34 PM):  everyone learns best when tehy're interested
irene (20:55:45 PM):  :)
rita (20:55:56 PM):  So imagine having to research Thailand ... think about what you would find online and perhaps you parents could take you to a Thai Restaurant ... what could this program provide that the internet wouldn't?
vicky (20:56:13 PM):  a censored version of a visit to thailand
melany (20:56:17 PM):  hmmmm
vicky (20:56:22 PM):  it's a pretty notorious place
irene (20:56:25 PM):  imagine a 3d tour of thailand
melany (20:56:38 PM):  it could provide videos from families living in Thailand
melany (20:56:42 PM):  descirbing their culture
irene (20:56:43 PM):  think about avatar
irene (20:56:45 PM):  if any of you saw it
irene (20:56:52 PM):  the 3d graphics were absolutely beaufitul
irene (20:56:56 PM):  *beautiful
rita (20:56:59 PM):  Well ... traditional customs ... Dance, music, tour of historic sites all in #-D
rita (20:57:03 PM):  3D
irene (20:57:07 PM):  honestly i don;t know if i'd like the movie as much if i didn't see it in 3d
melany (20:57:08 PM):  that was would be intriguing
melany (20:57:17 PM):  it would probably stay with them over time as well
luke (20:57:20 PM):  yeaa i guess it depends on how well they produce it
irene (20:57:29 PM):  and if we showed them the beautiful places of the world in 3d how could they not be interested
irene (20:57:33 PM):  they should do this for all schools
irene (20:57:36 PM):  not just elementary
melany (20:57:44 PM):  yeah exactly
melany (20:58:04 PM):  it could be a great way to convey all different types of topic
melany (20:58:10 PM):  do you think it could be used for math?
luke (20:58:18 PM):  ehh it would be hard
luke (20:58:22 PM):  im sure they could do it somehow
irene (20:58:28 PM):  yeah math would be really hard
melany (20:58:32 PM):  i could only think for the memorization of times tables
melany (20:58:36 PM):  for multiplication
luke (20:58:41 PM):  it would still be boring lol
irene (20:58:47 PM):  lol
melany (20:58:48 PM):  oh definetly
rita (20:58:54 PM):  Ok - so we are 2/3rds done ... We need to make some decisions and figure out how the selection criteria are being used to make these decisions
melany (20:59:19 PM):  which topic should we do this for?
rita (20:59:42 PM):  Are we all on board with Geography? Or should we be revisiting the other topics?
irene (20:59:50 PM):  im for geo
luke (20:59:53 PM):  I like geogrpahy
vicky (20:59:55 PM):  me too
melany (21:01:03 PM):  i think geography works best
irene (21:01:07 PM):  we should talk to the school board too
irene (21:01:10 PM):  hypothetically
irene (21:01:14 PM):  they would have good input
irene (21:01:23 PM):  they know students best
vicky (21:01:24 PM):  it seem to meet criteria 2 and 3 the best
vicky (21:01:24 PM):  # which program has the most relatable and interesting content for students? # most important factor) which program will have the most educational impact when compared to or augmented by traditional teaching methods?
melany (21:01:29 PM):  yes and teachers
luke (21:01:43 PM):  yeaa it did
rita (21:01:54 PM):  So we think of all the topics (History, Art, Science, Biology, Geography) Geography will be the most relatable and interesting for students as well as have the most educational impact
irene (21:02:10 PM):  yep
irene (21:02:12 PM):  they're being tested on it
melany (21:02:14 PM):  yes
irene (21:02:16 PM):  and that's a huge factor too
irene (21:02:53 PM):  i mean the others would be really cool too
irene (21:02:59 PM):  but yeah
rita (21:03:03 PM):  As far as ease of learning and use ... that is impossible to predict since it depends on the computer program design which we can not forsee, really
melany (21:03:16 PM):  true
luke (21:03:19 PM):  yea
vicky (21:03:19 PM):  yep
rita (21:03:39 PM):  Are there any other selection criteria we should be adding?
vicky (21:03:52 PM):  for the sake of argument
vicky (21:03:59 PM):  we could talk about the advantage of using software vs. the internet
vicky (21:04:03 PM):  ?
vicky (21:04:09 PM):  that seemed to be a fruitful topic
vicky (21:04:15 PM):  as it pertains to this discussion, that is
irene (21:04:16 PM):  it's unique and never been tried
melany (21:04:19 PM):  true
rita (21:04:21 PM):  Like ... would it be based online or on CD-ROM
irene (21:04:24 PM):  and it will look good for the schools
irene (21:04:33 PM):  i just picture 3d goggles
rita (21:04:38 PM):  Cool
luke (21:05:10 PM):  ha yea or those glasses they give u at the movies
rita (21:05:17 PM):  Have you seen the new Crayola kit that allows kids to draw in 3D
melany (21:05:18 PM):  yea haha
melany (21:05:22 PM):  ITS SO COOL
irene (21:05:27 PM):  wow i want them
luke (21:05:53 PM):  thats awesome they prob could use that in schools too
rita (21:06:00 PM):  That could be a traditional thing the teacher incorporates in the classroom to pare with the program
irene (21:06:05 PM):  yeah!
irene (21:06:13 PM):  but are teh crayons expensive
irene (21:06:21 PM):  i mean i guess compared to teh other 3d stuff not really
rita (21:06:23 PM):  Not too bad
luke (21:06:44 PM):  i wonder hwo that works
irene (21:06:45 PM):  how much are they
rita (21:06:48 PM):  You get specially glasses ... why I thought of it
irene (21:06:49 PM):  because i want them
melany (21:07:37 PM):  idk im curious
rita (21:07:49 PM):  link
irene (21:08:31 PM):  i want more variety thoug
irene (21:08:33 PM):  like colored pencils
irene (21:08:45 PM):  but i'm digressing
irene (21:08:49 PM):  so..
luke (21:08:57 PM):  well again my comp sucks and wont load it im not sure why i try
irene (21:08:57 PM):  what type of geography would we teach
luke (21:09:27 PM):  i honestly cant remember many types from the top of my head right now
irene (21:09:39 PM):  maybe if we google 5th grade geography
melany (21:09:49 PM):  yea for NYS
luke (21:09:54 PM):  i suppose the continents are very important i remember learning those over and over
irene (21:10:04 PM):  yes
rita (21:10:10 PM):  Another criteria: I think the flexibility of the program ... like if the kids can use it over and over once they learn to use the program ... in 5th grade for countries, in 6th grade for states, in 7th grade for current events
melany (21:10:11 PM):  yeah definetly
irene (21:10:20 PM):  they create the regents in albany so clearly it's important here
melany (21:10:22 PM):  the could incooperate music into the program as well
melany (21:10:28 PM):  i remember learning a song for the continents
luke (21:10:33 PM):  me too
irene (21:10:35 PM):  songs make things easier to remember
rita (21:11:01 PM):  Exactly luke, for basic things for littler kids like continents and oceans
luke (21:11:12 PM):  yeaa def oceans too
irene (21:11:17 PM):  like the animaniacs country and their capital song
vicky (21:11:26 PM):  would 5th graders be too old though?
luke (21:11:27 PM):  and directions N,S,E,W
vicky (21:11:29 PM):  they might think it's cheesy
luke (21:11:35 PM):  the compass rose i mean
irene (21:11:42 PM):  oh well, cheesy but effective
melany (21:11:47 PM):  i feel like it would be cheesy but effective
irene (21:11:47 PM):  the 3d will look cool so they won't care as much
melany (21:11:51 PM):  haha exactly irene
irene (21:11:54 PM):  :)
rita (21:12:43 PM):  Anything that breaks up the monotony should be good
irene (21:12:51 PM):  yeah
luke (21:12:53 PM):  truee
irene (21:13:09 PM):  3d shouldn't be the ONLY way we teach
irene (21:13:11 PM):  but it's nice to switch it up
melany (21:13:18 PM):  yeah i feel like it may turn into that too
rita (21:13:19 PM):  It will at least be something that brings them together if only to complain about it being lame
luke (21:13:27 PM):  yea im sure if it was the only way to teach they would get bored of that too
melany (21:13:28 PM):  eventually all hte movies will be 3D
irene (21:13:38 PM):  you think so?
irene (21:13:40 PM):  i've heard that
irene (21:13:44 PM):  but that will make me sad
melany (21:13:59 PM):  i hope not
rita (21:14:01 PM):  The new Tim Burton Alice in Wonderland is 3D
melany (21:14:06 PM):  i cant wait for that]
rita (21:14:08 PM):  I can't wait
melany (21:14:09 PM):  it should be great
irene (21:14:14 PM):  oh yeah i want to see taht
rita (21:14:26 PM):  We will be in DisneyWorld when it opens next week
rita (21:14:35 PM):  Ahhh Sun
rita (21:14:41 PM):  :-)
irene (21:14:47 PM):  lucky
luke (21:14:55 PM):  never been there lol im deprived
irene (21:15:10 PM):  haven't sincei was in 5th grade or something
melany (21:15:25 PM):  omg im so jealous i want to go to disney so bad
melany (21:15:30 PM):  its my favorite place!
rita (21:15:30 PM):  Well, I will be there with a four year old and a six month old ... fun but exhausting
luke (21:15:38 PM):  yeaa sounds like it
melany (21:15:39 PM):  yeah thats true
rita (21:16:06 PM):  Now think about Epcot ... that is an interesting way to present geography
irene (21:16:07 PM):  anything is exhausting with kids that age
irene (21:16:12 PM):  yeah true!
rita (21:16:47 PM):  I wonder if the program could be sort of like that ... or like Global SIMS
irene (21:16:56 PM):  maybe
melany (21:16:57 PM):  oh SIMS
rita (21:17:02 PM):  The kids might get into a program that was more like a game
irene (21:17:06 PM):  like the sims game?
rita (21:17:34 PM):  You could have to visit places to get knowledge to bring home to implement in your new nation
irene (21:17:43 PM):  yeah
irene (21:17:51 PM):  remember oregon trail? everyone played that in 5th grade
irene (21:17:57 PM):  we should have some virtual reality game for them
melany (21:17:58 PM):  omg i was obsessed
luke (21:18:03 PM):  never played haha
irene (21:18:09 PM):  it's amazing
melany (21:18:10 PM):  oregon trail could definetly be made into some sort of educational game
irene (21:18:13 PM):  yeah
vicky (21:18:15 PM):  it was 8-bit wasn't it?
irene (21:18:16 PM):  they used it all the time
vicky (21:18:16 PM):  haha
irene (21:18:17 PM):  yeah
vicky (21:18:18 PM):  DOS
irene (21:18:20 PM):  oh god
irene (21:18:21 PM):  dos
irene (21:18:21 PM):  hahah
melany (21:18:25 PM):  based on geography
rita (21:18:26 PM):  Kids like those giga pets you have to keep alive
irene (21:18:30 PM):  yeah
rita (21:18:33 PM):  Maybe something like that
irene (21:18:35 PM):  as long as you make the game right
melany (21:18:35 PM):  tamagotchis haha
irene (21:18:37 PM):  it'lll work
luke (21:18:40 PM):  old school
melany (21:18:40 PM):  or whatever they were called
rita (21:19:22 PM):  With 50,
rita (21:19:32 PM):  With 50K that could use handhelds
vicky (21:19:54 PM):  kids love cell phones/pda's
rita (21:20:03 PM):  Each student could have a wireless unit they could use to work on the game from home at night
vicky (21:20:10 PM):  maybe the $50k could partially be used towards handhelds, and make the software suitable for that
luke (21:20:11 PM):  yea that would be cool
rita (21:20:25 PM):  Like an iPhone app
irene (21:20:26 PM):  i feel like kids would break it
irene (21:20:33 PM):  i think we should keep it to the classroom
luke (21:20:37 PM):  well they have those mini comps on other countries that work well
rita (21:20:52 PM):  Hmmm ... well my cousin in Maine was given a laptop by the state in sixth grade
vicky (21:21:04 PM):  wow!
melany (21:21:04 PM):  thats great'
melany (21:21:09 PM):  my cousin gets one in HS
melany (21:21:14 PM):  she goes to school in NJ
vicky (21:21:20 PM):  that's really wild
luke (21:21:32 PM):  yeaaa
melany (21:21:44 PM):  so did we reached a consensus?
rita (21:21:44 PM):  soo see, good idea luke, mimi computers are like 200 or under
melany (21:21:48 PM):  times almost up
rita (21:21:55 PM):  mini computers would work great
rita (21:22:12 PM):  Have we answered the question?
melany (21:22:16 PM):  i believe so
irene (21:22:19 PM):  i think so
irene (21:22:30 PM):  we have a few minutes to discuss little details
irene (21:22:33 PM):  but we all seem to agree
rita (21:22:41 PM):  I agree ... now I just want to play the game
luke (21:22:41 PM):  yeaaaa
vicky (21:22:42 PM):  yeah, I think we agreed about 45 minutes ago
vicky (21:22:43 PM):  haha
melany (21:22:47 PM):  hahah as always'
irene (21:23:10 PM):  yeah
irene (21:23:10 PM):  lol
rita (21:23:45 PM):  Now, what should not be missed at Disney World? I've been in Seattle for 10 years so we have been doing Disneyland ... haven't been to DW since 1999
melany (21:23:57 PM):  pirates of the carribean is a nice ride
irene (21:23:59 PM):  i was probably last there around 1999 too
melany (21:24:04 PM):  not scary but very cool
rita (21:24:05 PM):  Has anyone been to the safari part?
vicky (21:24:07 PM):  --- never been
irene (21:24:09 PM):  well she has a 4 year old is it a crazy ride?
luke (21:24:13 PM):  never been either
melany (21:24:26 PM):  its in magic kingdom (pirates)
melany (21:24:31 PM):  do you have a girl?
melany (21:24:38 PM):  because its a small world is not to be missed then
rita (21:24:38 PM):  It is a very fun College spring break trip
rita (21:25:01 PM):  My son is 4 and my daughter is 6 months
irene (21:25:09 PM):  cute
rita (21:25:16 PM):  So, yay, we get to do princesses this time!!!
melany (21:25:24 PM):  aw very cute. its a small world is a very nice ride for that age.
melany (21:25:27 PM):  so is pirates
rita (21:25:31 PM):  Before it was all Buzz Lightyear, etc
irene (21:25:32 PM):  cute
melany (21:25:38 PM):  and peter pan's magic flight
irene (21:25:40 PM):  oh i loved the buzz light year thing
melany (21:25:43 PM):  that was fun
rita (21:26:05 PM):  My son's friend was Buzz for Halloween - wicked cute!
melany (21:26:07 PM):  dumbo is always fun
irene (21:26:08 PM):  disney is just fun
melany (21:26:14 PM):  such a nice atmosphere
melany (21:26:23 PM):  definetly go to tooontown in magic kingdom
melany (21:26:26 PM):  to meet the characters
moderator (21:26:40 PM):  Hello everyone. As we near the end I'd like to remind everyone to please fill out the survey before you leave.
melany (21:26:41 PM):  and take lots of pictures :)
moderator (21:26:42 PM):  link
melany (21:26:48 PM):  thanks!
luke (21:27:04 PM):  thanks
rita (21:27:14 PM):  I got a flip for xmas ... I am excited about videos too! But lots of pictures for sure
rita (21:27:40 PM):  Thanks everyone ... leading was fun ... you are a great group ... YAY group B
melany (21:27:58 PM):  hahah thanks for being a great leader!
vicky (21:28:19 PM):  good chat
vicky (21:28:21 PM):  night all
luke (21:28:40 PM):  byeeeeee
melany (21:28:51 PM):  bye!
irene (21:28:55 PM):  bye
rita (21:31:28 PM):  Bye

michael (8:02:49 PM):  Sorry about the trouble, heh. I'll be gentle with my computer from now on.
george (8:03:15 PM):  are you reading the resumes, amy?
amy (8:03:27 PM):  Looks like last one Sandra does not meet the educational level requirement (not a soph yet)
george (8:04:19 PM):  *looks around*
george (8:05:35 PM):  hello?
michael (8:05:37 PM):  Hello, I was having some computer trouble so didn't get earlier messages. We're reviewing the job and resumes on the site?
amy (8:05:56 PM):  george and michael-  can you read this-  not sure if i'm in even thgouh my name is listed in blue
george (8:06:06 PM):  yea i think that's the plan
george (8:06:09 PM):  yea, i can see that amy
michael (8:06:16 PM):  Yep, I can see that amy.
george (8:07:10 PM):  ok so did you guys read the resumes?
amy (8:07:21 PM):  yes
george (8:07:34 PM):  maybe we can go one at a time
amy (8:07:37 PM):  the last one isnt qualified- too young?
george (8:08:08 PM):  i have 3 windows open; one for this chat, one for the job description, one for the resumes
michael (8:08:09 PM):  I looked through them earlier, yes.
george (8:08:18 PM):  ok let me look at last one
george (8:08:49 PM):  sandra cavanaugh
amy (8:09:00 PM):  right- sandra
george (8:09:07 PM):  looks like she's finishing her freshman year
michael (8:09:22 PM):  Oh, because of the 2012 graduation date?
amy (8:09:44 PM):  oh maybe you're right george- so she will be a soph
george (8:10:03 PM):  it says she got her high school diploma may 2008
george (8:10:24 PM):  and yes, expected graduation 2012
amy (8:10:39 PM):  so everyone is qualified based on edu level
amy (8:10:58 PM):  sgall we look at gpa now-  must be at least 2.5
george (8:11:28 PM):  well, let's put sandra on hold because she doesn't meet one of the job description requirements
michael (8:11:32 PM):  What semester is the job for, though?
michael (8:12:04 PM):  If she becomes a sophmore at the end of the year and the job is for next year...
george (8:12:08 PM):  it just says must be available for two semesters upon initial hire
george (8:12:28 PM):  i think she needs to be an upper classman
amy (8:12:35 PM):  1. You must be at least sophomore status at the end of the semester in which you are applying (i.e. May for a fall position)
amy (8:13:02 PM):  that is a little confusing to me   : )
george (8:13:09 PM):  oh so she could be applying a year in advance you're saying?
amy (8:13:34 PM):  so if she is applying right now (May), she must be a sop currently?
amy (8:14:12 PM):  i think you need to be a soph period
george (8:14:35 PM):  oh maybe a sophomore can be hired then
amy (8:15:18 PM):  if sandra is a frosh, then she is not qualified so she is crossed off our list for a candidate
george (8:15:22 PM):  she does have a high GPA
george (8:16:26 PM):  yea it's a bit of grey area she's in with the graduation date and application date
amy (8:16:27 PM):  there might be another reason for not hiring her for that position though-  she doesnt have much experience at the school?
michael (8:16:32 PM):  An AP student too. I remember my undergrad school let people with a lot of AP courses apply for upperclassman status.
michael (8:17:29 PM):  I guess in real life I might just ring her up and clear up any possible misunderstandings before I nix her.
amy (8:17:42 PM):  absolutely michael
george (8:17:51 PM):  she's got experience organizing a children's day camp...maybe the skills can be extrapolated and applied to the residence halls ;-)
michael (8:17:52 PM):  That's true, more experience is better.
amy (8:18:10 PM):  yeah- i first liked her the best actually- then noticed that one thing
george (8:19:05 PM):  ok, let's check out another candidate
amy (8:19:21 PM):  penny jones looks good too-
george (8:19:26 PM):  how about penny jones?
george (8:19:34 PM):  she's the first one
amy (8:19:53 PM):  pet sitting, child care, volunteer service, honor society
george (8:20:00 PM):  high GPA, expected graduation 2010
amy (8:21:03 PM):  i would keep her as a possibility-  anyone else?
george (8:21:12 PM):  just wondering...are computer skills relevant to the job?
michael (8:21:13 PM):  Child care is a good plus for this job.
george (8:22:12 PM):  does she need to give power point presentations to the residence halls?
amy (8:22:16 PM):  good communicaiton skills
michael (8:22:35 PM):  I don't see anything about computers in the job description.
george (8:23:07 PM):  yea, just sometimes makes me wonder why people would draw attention to irrelevant information
michael (8:23:11 PM):  It would be nice if an RA could help the other students out if they come to them with problems enrolling in courses or something, though. Although I suppose there is official tech support for that sort of thing.
amy (8:23:30 PM):  computer knowledge today is relevant in any job i believe
amy (8:23:53 PM):  or it can just be a plus
george (8:23:55 PM):  or how aobut that she plays piano
amy (8:24:07 PM):  well roundedness
michael (8:24:15 PM):  I went into one of the towers once to turn in an ID card someone dropped outside and the person in the office was sitting in front of a computer, heh. Tough to imagine there is an RA web site they use, though, heh.
amy (8:24:19 PM):  meaning she can get along with different ypes of people
amy (8:24:21 PM):  types
amy (8:24:55 PM):  they must have been "silling up time" michael   lol
amy (8:24:57 PM):  filling
george (8:25:24 PM):  i like the volunteering experience
michael (8:25:40 PM):  True, having a computer in the office is a good way to make the time periods when there is nothing to do less boring.
george (8:26:11 PM):  but i get the impression the interests/activities and computer skills are just there to make the resume look robust
michael (8:26:16 PM):  Well roundedness sounds good. My freshmen RA used to host movies in his room and take us out to sports bars...
michael (8:26:43 PM):  His interests were movies and sports, though. Maybe she'll use her interests to start a tennis ladder or lessons or something that match hers.
george (8:27:03 PM):  but if this can go on a resume, maybe we'd be better off choosing someone who could use this job on their resume
amy (8:27:09 PM):  ok- who's next to look at?
amy (8:27:25 PM):  then we can re-evaluate all of them once we know our initial thoughts.   this sound good?
george (8:27:28 PM):  how about jade edwards
george (8:27:45 PM):  sure, sounds good amy
michael (8:27:53 PM):  Is Freshport valid? He seems to have graduated...
michael (8:28:05 PM):  Oh, was typing at the same time. I'll go look at Edwards.
george (8:29:12 PM):  junior status
george (8:29:22 PM):  BS mechanical science 2011
george (8:29:33 PM):  2nd degree maybe?
amy (8:29:46 PM):  in this case, because of extra-curricular activities- i would keep them on the list....otherwise i might not think they would know how to relate to people
michael (8:30:59 PM):  Hmm, is there a 5 year program or something similar?
george (8:31:24 PM):  yea it isn't clear what jade is up to
michael (8:31:38 PM):  My non-SUNY undergrad school had those. One was a coop program where you did work study at industry locations, other was reduced load.
george (8:32:16 PM):  yea, could be something like that
amy (8:33:30 PM):  does she appear to meet min. quals?
michael (8:33:34 PM):  Hmm, I like the "supervised three employees". Child care with the other person and supervising here, I think you learn to handle problems that come up more professionally.
george (8:33:44 PM):  seems to, yes
amy (8:33:56 PM):  sure
george (8:34:28 PM):  fluent in german, now the german students won't have to worry about getting a translator while they are in the residence halls!
amy (8:35:05 PM):  yeah- lang skills may be helpful for a dorm\
amy (8:35:23 PM):  she might be able to push people if they're having trouble
michael (8:35:24 PM):  hehe
george (8:35:45 PM):  she can yell at them in german!
michael (8:35:45 PM):  I wonder if students with all the same language get grouped together?
amy (8:35:52 PM):  ok...andrew cobb
george (8:35:54 PM):  lol
michael (8:36:09 PM):  I know my coaches specifically worked to group use track athletes together, so we'd be waking each other up for meets and the like.
george (8:36:10 PM):  k
amy (8:36:12 PM):  nah- i doubt it michael...but maybe some schools do have such an option-  that owuld be neat
michael (8:36:18 PM):  us* track, even
george (8:36:41 PM):  i think they do something like that at purdue university
amy (8:36:43 PM):  i guess ya never know then!  maybe there are groups of kids
amy (8:36:59 PM):  easier to make friends too possibly
george (8:37:06 PM):  but i think they actually strive to spread out the ethnicities rather than group them together
michael (8:37:11 PM):  Hmm, odds are probably low the RA would get German speaking students, then, though...
michael (8:37:38 PM):  Oh, I can see that, hmm.
amy (8:37:51 PM):  hmmmm. ....frat boy coming up
amy (8:37:55 PM):  andrew
george (8:38:26 PM):  when it says GPA 3.0/4.0 does that mean major/minor?
george (8:38:35 PM):  or major/ overall
michael (8:39:36 PM):  I was assuming that was value/total, but admit I'm not sure.
george (8:39:46 PM):  oh can't be overall, i am not thinking
michael (8:39:53 PM):  Some high schools go up to 5.0 or weird stuff like that do to honors courses...
george (8:40:02 PM):  probably means overall/major
amy (8:40:12 PM):  i'm not sure what it means either
amy (8:40:24 PM):  but 3.0 or 4.0 is pretty good    lol
michael (8:40:51 PM):  Jones and Cavanaugh both have the /4.0 too.
george (8:41:19 PM):  i think that's overall GPA / major GPA
amy (8:42:01 PM):  sounds good
michael (8:42:07 PM):  Hmm, first Google result I see for "gpa "out og"" mentions: "Report GPA as 3.7 / 4.0 (3.7 out of a possible 4.0)"
george (8:42:15 PM):  *shrug* i guess it don't matter that much
michael (8:42:38 PM):  That's for Purdue or whatever, though. Maybe not good to go by random Google results, heh.
george (8:43:04 PM):  oh that makes sense too
amy (8:43:12 PM):  i'm not fond of the next one bc seems that compared to the rest, the communication skills/ people skills are suited to college student assistance
george (8:43:19 PM):  so he's  a B student
amy (8:43:24 PM):  are not suited-  sorry
michael (8:43:45 PM):  Hmm, Cobb?
amy (8:44:23 PM):  yeah
michael (8:45:02 PM):  OK....did you mean "aren't suited"?
amy (8:45:34 PM):  right-  he doesnt seem to me what a parent might want in the dorm assisting freshman
george (8:45:43 PM):  well, he does have this "Created multimedia presentation using slides, music, and narration to brief incoming UI students during orientation
amy (8:46:14 PM):  but orientation leaders do that stuff- people who work at the campus events office
amy (8:46:37 PM):  a friend of mine is in charge of putting together programs for new students-  she is 32
george (8:46:41 PM):  true, perhaps he just spliced video and put some music to it
amy (8:47:00 PM):  it could be helpful definitely though just like any computer skills....
michael (8:47:20 PM):  Hmm, I do like the hiring, training, and night manager experience, though. Those are all dealing with people.
amy (8:47:32 PM):  haha  right george, maybe a well to bulk up the resume iwth fancy terminology?   Lol
george (8:47:39 PM):  perhaps he will use the residence halls for a recruitment center for his Pi Sigma Epsilon fraternity!
amy (8:47:50 PM):  hehe
george (8:48:09 PM):  he will bring hazing to the residence halls
george (8:48:37 PM):  is it bad to discuss applications this way?
amy (8:48:53 PM):  if he was a night manager why didnt he list it as experiene with dates though?  i can only wonder what he means-  like did he fll in occassionly?   a question for the interview if he makes it that far
george (8:48:55 PM):  i did mean to be humorous with that statement... :P
amy (8:49:23 PM):  well george- i was wondering about his frat background-  although he may very well be a good candidate- we must choose the best one for the job at hand
george (8:49:36 PM):  he did refurbish a restaurant...perhaps he can refurbish our residence halls!
george (8:49:39 PM):  lol
amy (8:49:44 PM):  do we like him?
george (8:50:00 PM):  yea, for some reason i don't like him
george (8:50:19 PM):  we don't need hazing in the halls!
amy (8:50:22 PM):  to me, he doesnt compare to the other we looked at
george (8:50:50 PM):  i think that's how the review process works...when you find a few people you like, it's quick to sign off other applicants
amy (8:50:56 PM):  i would keep him as a backup maybe if other people arent interested in coming for an interview or whatever,.,.... know what i mean?
michael (8:51:04 PM):  Hmm, he has more experience than Edwards and only a 3 instead of a 3.2...
michael (8:51:14 PM):  GPA wise.
michael (8:51:42 PM):  Just don't quite see what is wrong myself.
amy (8:52:10 PM):  oh the grades are fine for all the people
amy (8:52:21 PM):  we'll keep him on the list for now.... who's next?
george (8:52:36 PM):  i don't think he's a terrible applicant, but after seeing a few others i feel there's room to put him on back burner
george (8:52:46 PM):  evan is last one
amy (8:53:44 PM):  ok evan- the one you were looking at before michael...any first thoughts?
michael (8:53:51 PM):  Did Evan graduate already? I don't see an expected graduation date...
amy (8:54:02 PM):  its all the way to the right
george (8:54:11 PM):  it's spaced weird, it's to the right
amy (8:54:24 PM):  '11  may
michael (8:54:29 PM):  Oh, wow, there it is. Was off my screen. Thanks.
amy (8:54:35 PM):  :)
amy (8:55:14 PM):  another frat
amy (8:55:25 PM):  however this guy has certification in first aid/cpr which is good
george (8:55:33 PM):  i like this guy more than cobb for some reason
amy (8:55:51 PM):  oops i made a mistake i believe about the frat
amy (8:56:00 PM):  Member, Delta Epsilon Chi (DECA) Marketing Club, Borah High		Sept. 05 – May 08
amy (8:56:16 PM):  what does that mean?  in high school this was the club name??
michael (8:56:17 PM):  Hmm, no management experience. Spanish is a plus, though. Probably even more students speaking that than German.
george (8:56:33 PM):  dunno maybe he's frat
michael (8:56:45 PM):  I didn't realize there were frats in high school...
amy (8:57:01 PM):  right- no mngmt exp but did the others have it-  sandra. penny?
amy (8:57:09 PM):  maybe its just the club name?
michael (8:58:01 PM):  Both of those had some sort of child care experience, though.
amy (8:58:30 PM):  right- child care, pet sitting  so those indicate supervisory in some respects
michael (8:58:38 PM):  Oh, link says "We are an international association of high school and college students studying marketing, management and entrepreneurship in business, finance, hospitality and marketing sales and service."
amy (8:59:05 PM):  LOL   nice job michael!
george (8:59:13 PM):  ah, that's just a marketing community of some sort
amy (8:59:51 PM):  not that we are discounting frat people....but rather comparing there experiences to all other candidates
michael (8:59:53 PM):  Different group, but the FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America) seemed really classy back in high school. All the nearby shop owners were complaining students littered too much and were trying to get students constrained to the school, so the FBLA had a cleanup day where they and students helped cleanup the town.
amy (9:00:05 PM):  just want to make sure we're not being prjudiced here     lol
amy (9:00:34 PM):  that sounds familiar- future business leaders   interesting
george (9:01:50 PM):  ok, job description: 1. Become personally acquainted with each resident on his/her floor and build a rapport that will foster open communication   2. Assist new students in their adaptation to University life.   3. Become familiar with fire safety equipment, and coordinate the fire drill program on the floor   4. Assist the Residence Hall Director as assigned in emergencies.
michael (9:01:52 PM):  Greek seems like a plus to me, more people experience.  Although I admit I only hit some of my first college parties at frats and had a pre-frosh weekend stay at a frat, never joined.
george (9:02:41 PM):  in my opinion, #1 and #2 are the most important responsibilities that pertain to these applications
amy (9:03:12 PM):  i guess good communication skills and leadership ability is key
george (9:03:15 PM):  the other 2 are basically follow instructions
george (9:03:26 PM):  yeah...
michael (9:03:33 PM):  Hmm, good point.
george (9:03:43 PM):  i personally would lean towards the volunteer work they've done
george (9:04:32 PM):  tho you're right the communication skills are valuable too
amy (9:05:08 PM):  i like the volunteer experiences definitely
george (9:05:13 PM):  for that reason, i kinda like sandra
george (9:05:32 PM):  and penny
amy (9:05:53 PM):  sandra:  Organized and supervised activities for children’s day camp
amy (9:06:24 PM):  penny: Volunteer Experience, child care, petsitting
amy (9:06:31 PM):  just throwing some good points out
george (9:07:04 PM):  it just seems sandra would try to fulfill #2, and #1 as well
amy (9:07:07 PM):  evan doesnt possess anything i would throw out to you that is super
michael (9:07:16 PM):  Hmm, the "Big Brother / Big Sisters" program listed in Jones' sounds applicable to 1/2 as well.
george (9:07:49 PM):  yeah, that is good too
amy (9:08:24 PM):  i like that penny has been at the school a little longer
george (9:08:44 PM):  penny seems to have the most volunteer work out of them all
amy (9:08:54 PM):  i would agree with michael here
amy (9:09:43 PM):  the only question about her is if she can handle supervising tasks
george (9:09:56 PM):  i'm finding it hard to beat penny at this point
amy (9:10:06 PM):  only bc sandra has the camp experience
amy (9:10:31 PM):  i'm in for penny too  - just trying to cover all points i guess-   i get bogged down
amy (9:11:10 PM):  michael, what do you say?
george (9:11:46 PM):  what is "Habitat for Humanity"
michael (9:11:52 PM):  Was just looking over Evan. The Spanish and some frat participation seem like plusses, and he has some work experience, but everyone has that. Guess I have to agree nothing much sticks out as super about him.
michael (9:12:05 PM):  Hmm, you build houses for people in that program, don't you?
amy (9:12:29 PM):  habitat?   yes build houses
george (9:12:48 PM):  ah yea i'm looking at that now
michael (9:12:49 PM):  Is it just in other countries, or do they do things here too?
george (9:13:06 PM):  looks like here too
amy (9:13:10 PM):  thats here also   its a common thing people do
george (9:13:46 PM):  that's a nice thing to do but might not be as relevant to the job description as some of the other stuff
george (9:13:55 PM):  (was jade btw)
amy (9:14:35 PM):  jade didnt seem so personable to me
amy (9:14:39 PM):  on paper
michael (9:14:59 PM):  I like how it shows you are willing to give your time to other people...
amy (9:15:07 PM):  yeah relevancy to the description is #1
george (9:15:14 PM):  andrew isn't actually a bad candidate on second thought....not as good as penny but not as bad as i first thought
michael (9:15:50 PM):  If a student comes to them with a problem it feels like they will be less likely to brush them off.
amy (9:16:23 PM):  Cold canvassed community for potential clients    what does that mean??
george (9:16:34 PM):  penny is a psych major...perhaps she is playing our psychology!
amy (9:16:35 PM):  like cold-calling??
amy (9:17:13 PM):  lol
george (9:17:22 PM):  looks like it is AKA cold-calling, amy
michael (9:17:30 PM):  Just looking at Cobb in comparison I don't see much volunteer work.
amy (9:17:37 PM):  andrew does not appeal to me as someone who will "care" for people he is working for (the students in the dorm)
amy (9:18:29 PM):  we have 4 mins to decide who the Chosen One is   - just to let ya know
michael (9:18:30 PM):  I guess there is the "brief incoming UI students during orientation". I agree, though.
george (9:18:41 PM):  oh that's it?
george (9:18:53 PM):  i vote for penny
michael (9:19:03 PM):  I guess I've crossed off Cobb and Evan...hmm.
amy (9:19:18 PM):  dont let us persuade you michael!   hahaha
amy (9:20:12 PM):  I vote Penny!  with a close runner up Sandra
michael (9:20:22 PM):  Hmm, I'll vote for Penny as well. I like that brother/sister experience for this job.
michael (9:20:48 PM):  Would be nice to have some phone conversations and interviews with people, though.
amy (9:20:54 PM):  just to add-  we dont know what she did when volunteering,,,,,office work??   but i would choose her to come in for an interview over all the others first
george (9:20:54 PM):  i guess at this point we'd set up an interview with penny!
amy (9:21:07 PM):  Woo-hoo!
george (9:22:12 PM):  ok, good i think we met our objective :P
amy (9:22:13 PM):  well that was fun (sorta)
george (9:22:22 PM):  have a nice night!  i'm off
michael (9:22:33 PM):  I managed not to crash my computer again at least. ^^
amy (9:22:35 PM):  nice fighting it out with your guys-   nice work   night!
michael (9:22:37 PM):  Good night.
amy (9:22:43 PM):  haha-  see ya michael

michael (8:18:15 PM):  Hello
michael (8:19:32 PM):  Too bad the software isn't IRC based.  Could just use the /topic command to always have a reminder at the top.
michael (8:19:56 PM):  Hi amy.
amy (8:20:09 PM):  Hello!
amy (8:21:08 PM):  i was just trying to read the articles sent to us
michelle (8:21:42 PM):  hi
michael (8:22:01 PM):  Yeah, I was browsing through the links too.
michael (8:22:06 PM):  Hi michelle.
george (8:22:12 PM):  hello
michael (8:23:18 PM):  We're one person more than Sunday at least. ^^
amy (8:24:20 PM):  i think that was the night i completely forgout about the session   : (
michael (8:24:46 PM):  Oh, I thought it was you, me, and george then.
michael (8:25:01 PM):  Sunday night anyway, there was a Sunday morning too that time, I think.
michael (8:25:43 PM):  Oh, well, we filled up the time that time OK.
michael (8:25:51 PM):  Anyone have any initial thoughts?
michael (8:26:19 PM):  I was thinking the big oil prices had almost as big an effect on auto-makers as the recession....
michael (8:27:10 PM):  they were concentrating on SUVs and trucks, but those suddenly became bad sellers.
amy (8:27:37 PM):  have you seen big changes in prices of any cars, suvs, etc?
michelle (8:27:55 PM):  agree. without recession, they are still going to face tough time. recession just makes it worse
amy (8:27:55 PM):  i didnt notice anything coming down but maybe i didnt notice
george (8:28:31 PM):  unions made it hard to run their businesses too
michael (8:28:32 PM):  Hmm, my family has always bought used, didn't notice much change there, ha.
michael (8:29:48 PM):  One of the wiki articles mentioned cases were small cars were sold at a loss...
michael (8:30:07 PM):  The auto makers were hoping the customer would then stick with the brand for their next upgrade or something.
meg (8:30:10 PM):  Hi everyone
michelle (8:30:20 PM):  hi
amy (8:30:26 PM):  hello meg  : )
michael (8:30:27 PM):  The profity margins on the trucks and SUVs sounded like they could be cut to lower prices, though.
michael (8:30:30 PM):  Hi meg.
george (8:30:35 PM):  hi2u
meg (8:30:52 PM):  :) Sorry I'm a little late
meg (8:31:02 PM):  I was reading and lost track of time
meg (8:31:10 PM):  So we're talking about cars huh?
amy (8:31:15 PM):  the prices of cars seem so high and i dont believe factory workers get paid very much....who is making the $   the people running the business
michael (8:31:24 PM):  That's good, you'll have more to say. ^^
meg (8:31:40 PM):  hopefully!
meg (8:32:27 PM):  I dunno, I think it was interesting that Obama is giving directives to Chevy
michael (8:32:48 PM):  There are a lot less people running the business, though.
george (8:33:05 PM):  that is possible...obama seems to take it upon himself and the govt to "fix" things
meg (8:33:10 PM):  Did you guys hear about Chrysler?
george (8:33:27 PM):  yup chapter 11
amy (8:33:33 PM):  yeah
meg (8:33:39 PM):  I watched part of his address last night and GM is up next on June 11th?
meg (8:33:57 PM):  No strike that its june 1st
meg (8:34:22 PM):  They have to do some sort of restructuring plan
amy (8:34:34 PM):  many businesses go out though- i have sympathy for all the people working there- but isnt time to re-evaluate how to run a business?
meg (8:34:56 PM):  Its time for a lot of things with our economy ahhaha
george (8:35:08 PM):  yes
amy (8:35:10 PM):  agreed
meg (8:35:13 PM):  I want to buy a new car because mine is getting up there in milage
george (8:35:18 PM):  and obama needs to put away our country's credit card!  :(
meg (8:35:24 PM):  I'm really not sure what type to pick
michael (8:35:27 PM):  Bankruptcy is bad for the unions and thus workers, though. Deals get renegotiated.
amy (8:35:27 PM):  i think it has a lot to do with greed overall
meg (8:35:38 PM):  Hahaha credit card debt ruuns bills
amy (8:35:58 PM):  meg i bought a chevy malibu and i love it
meg (8:36:01 PM):  I am trying to pay it down but being is college is a lot more expensive than a lot of stuff
meg (8:36:07 PM):  Yeah we talked about this before
george (8:36:09 PM):  unions demanded too much from the companies tho, that was a big drag on the business
amy (8:36:11 PM):  not sure if you want chevy now though  lol  this was a year and a ahalf ago i bought it
michael (8:36:11 PM):  Hehe, I remember him mentioning on TV once that he didn't come into office wanting to spend so much.
michael (8:36:24 PM):  I guess he thinks it is the right thing to do to pull us out, though.
meg (8:36:24 PM):  I'm worried about buying a GM with the new problems
george (8:36:38 PM):  i'd go with hyundai :o
amy (8:36:39 PM):  i would be too
meg (8:36:51 PM):  I'm thinking about volkswagon
meg (8:36:56 PM):  I want a BEETLE:D
george (8:37:12 PM):  obama is not any different from other politicians...he lied to get into office
meg (8:37:15 PM):  Hahaha that way I know violence is ensuing while I drive past people playing punch bug!
michelle (8:37:21 PM):  wow, you guys type really fast. i can not follow it
meg (8:37:31 PM):  I dont honestly think that he's as bad as our last prez though
michael (8:37:42 PM):  Supposedly the government will back up warranties, so even if a maker goes out the car is *supposed* to be supported.
meg (8:37:54 PM):  Fingers crossed
amy (8:37:58 PM):  thats good news michael
george (8:38:02 PM):  he's about the same as last pres. except people like him so far
meg (8:38:08 PM):  Hahaha
meg (8:38:10 PM):  True
meg (8:38:18 PM):  And he's against torture...
meg (8:38:27 PM):  Which I think is good
meg (8:38:52 PM):  plus he doesn't pronounce it new-cyu-lar
george (8:39:19 PM):  yea but he's driving us into debt we may never be able to repay :(
amy (8:39:36 PM):  ya gotta give him a chance i believe- we gave bush a chance and he didnt meet expectations.
meg (8:39:38 PM):  'Despite the turmoil with Chrysler and GM's looming deadline, Obama urged consumers to keep buying cars.'
meg (8:39:50 PM):  thats from an article that I was reading earlier
meg (8:39:56 PM):  He wants us to buy american cars
meg (8:40:02 PM):  Idk though
george (8:40:08 PM):  last thing we need is to spend!  haha
amy (8:40:10 PM):  how can 1 person save america in a few months?  it takes time to turn a boat around
meg (8:40:13 PM):  I have a ford right now
george (8:40:13 PM):  we need to save!
michael (8:40:14 PM):  Well, there are transplant factories too....
meg (8:40:23 PM):  I agree with amy
michael (8:40:24 PM):  You can buy a made in America car from a foreign name, basically.
meg (8:40:46 PM):  Which companies do that?
george (8:41:05 PM):  i say buy the best car for you, not best for failing companies
meg (8:41:05 PM):  It all comes down to what I can afford to buy too
amy (8:41:08 PM):  so americans are building cars for foreign companies?
amy (8:41:13 PM):  transplant?
michael (8:41:22 PM):  Hmm, Toyota has transplant factories, I think.
amy (8:41:30 PM):  i bought a chevy with usa in mind
amy (8:41:41 PM):  but yes, gotta do whats best for you
meg (8:42:08 PM):  thats a good plan
meg (8:42:26 PM):  I need a car good on mileage, so I was actually looking into the Honda Fit
michael (8:42:29 PM):  That's the term used for the factory in the US owned by Toyota, etc..
meg (8:42:31 PM):  its 40 MGPG
michelle (8:42:46 PM):  that is pretty good mileage
meg (8:42:50 PM):  MPG
amy (8:42:50 PM):  gotcha
meg (8:42:51 PM):  hahah
michelle (8:42:58 PM):  Fit is bit small, though
george (8:43:02 PM):  perhaps the best thing for the car companies is bankruptcy...that's capitalism in its purest form- let them start over and restructure into a feasible business
meg (8:43:06 PM):  Yeah
george (8:43:21 PM):  is fit a newer prius?  imma look it up :P
amy (8:43:21 PM):  i thought that too michelle-  is it safe - check out the reports maybe?
meg (8:43:21 PM):  Gotta love capitalism
michelle (8:43:41 PM):  the reports will probably say it is safe
amy (8:43:43 PM):  totally george-  why should they get $ from govt??
michael (8:43:48 PM):  I remember some Maryland law professor in the bailout hearings kept saying that too, george.
amy (8:44:25 PM):  my htought is.....if a school down the street was having trouble and firing staff, why cant they go to the govt for loans??
amy (8:44:45 PM):  or any other kind of service, business, etc
meg (8:45:20 PM):  Makes sense
george (8:45:22 PM):  ooh honda fit is hot
meg (8:45:30 PM):  I think so
michael (8:45:31 PM):  That reminds me of the slogan the union I was in while working for SUNY System Administration was telling us to use for the recent budget cuts..."SUNY is the Solution".
meg (8:45:34 PM):  Its a sweet little ride
michael (8:46:00 PM):  Basically they were saying the government should keep up education spending because it results in jobs, etc..
meg (8:46:02 PM):  An old friend of mine says it drives like a dream
meg (8:46:10 PM):  she loves it
meg (8:46:20 PM):  I've gone through so many cars too, I want one to last
meg (8:46:24 PM):  I'm done with used cars
amy (8:46:32 PM):  what else is more important than education
george (8:46:33 PM):  14750 price, nice
meg (8:46:38 PM):  I don't mind small cars
meg (8:46:50 PM):  Hahaha a bit more than I want to spend
amy (8:46:56 PM):  i.e get intelligent people into these Big Companies to keep them doing well and maintaining their staff
meg (8:46:57 PM):  But I'll be saving on gas right?
meg (8:47:45 PM):  Yeah but who's hiring at this point
meg (8:47:48 PM):  ?
amy (8:47:52 PM):  i bought a nissan sentra in '00 for that price meg.....shouldt this car be lower than that car
michael (8:47:57 PM):  Hmm, I had a lot of trouble picking out what the companies actually did wrong to make their leaders stupid.
george (8:48:01 PM):  probably save some on gas...what's your current mpg?
amy (8:48:07 PM):  lol  michael
michael (8:48:18 PM):  They couldn't make a profit on small cars, sold big cars, big cars became unpopular.
michael (8:48:24 PM):  It was their only choice, though.
meg (8:48:28 PM):  20mpg highway
amy (8:48:30 PM):  your fit should be less than that sentra
meg (8:48:38 PM):  I drive a Minivan though
michael (8:48:42 PM):  Their deals with the unions, pensions, etc.. make their costs too high to compete with the companies that don't have those things.
meg (8:48:48 PM):  so I'm looking forward to a switch
michael (8:48:56 PM):  And those companies were making the small cars.
amy (8:49:10 PM):  well restructure is the key i guess
meg (8:49:26 PM):  Yeah but toyota was smart going to the prius first
amy (8:49:26 PM):  i dont know anything about the unions, pensions, etc
amy (8:49:48 PM):  but shouldnt it be a decent package- nothing too extreme and nothing so poor
amy (8:50:12 PM):  how does the educaiton system do it with teachers?
amy (8:50:16 PM):  education
michael (8:50:53 PM):  Hmm, teachers are union too, I think. My union was UUP which was a part of AFT, the teachers union.
amy (8:51:03 PM):  i dont see why the car companies are getting so much sympathy
george (8:51:06 PM):  you might be interested in hyundai accent if you like honda fit
meg (8:51:25 PM):  Is it small
meg (8:51:26 PM):  ?
meg (8:51:29 PM):  I want a small car
amy (8:51:32 PM):  i heard of uup
meg (8:51:41 PM):  I like how there's 2 convos going on now
michelle (8:51:52 PM):  UUP is a union.
amy (8:51:55 PM):  yeah- i noticed too-   just dont buy nissan!
george (8:51:55 PM):  let AIG, bank of america, etc fail
meg (8:51:58 PM):  Whats the MPG?
michelle (8:52:10 PM):  but much less powerful than UAW , the auto union. i think.
meg (8:52:12 PM):  I had a nissan
meg (8:52:15 PM):  I hated it
amy (8:52:26 PM):  they nust have been doing something in the wrong to fail completely
george (8:52:27 PM):  yes, meg, accent is small
michael (8:52:32 PM):  Maybe the demand for education, and thus teachers, doesn't change like the demand for cars does?
amy (8:52:44 PM):  Nissan sucks!
meg (8:52:50 PM):  It was used with 107 miles on it and a friend was going to junk it but i took it and it literally lasted 8 month
meg (8:52:51 PM):  s
meg (8:52:59 PM):  I'm looknig it up
amy (8:53:01 PM):  continue michael....
michelle (8:53:04 PM):  that is bad.
michelle (8:53:15 PM):  I have a honda pilot. a good car.
amy (8:53:22 PM):  what do u mean by demand?
michelle (8:53:26 PM):  i mean honda civic
meg (8:53:35 PM):  i like civics
meg (8:53:50 PM):  ooooh, I like the accent
meg (8:53:56 PM):  is that the type you have george?
george (8:54:02 PM):  says hyundai accent is 27/33 mpg
george (8:54:12 PM):  so around 27 city
meg (8:54:35 PM):  Nice
amy (8:54:37 PM):  how about the mini cooper ?
michael (8:54:39 PM):  Education seems like a necessity to me, that's all.
meg (8:54:41 PM):  Thats a lot better than mine
meg (8:54:43 PM):  I don't like them
george (8:54:54 PM):  yea i drive one
michael (8:55:01 PM):  With cars the demand dropped, there were some big numbers for the percentage of sales that went down.
amy (8:55:02 PM):  haha  it sure is a necessity
meg (8:55:06 PM):  I drive a lot on the taconic and my friend had his totaled by a deer
george (8:55:06 PM):  smart car = 33/41 mpg
michael (8:55:12 PM):  Tough to believe the percentage of needed teachers could ever drop that much.
meg (8:55:26 PM):  smart car= too small
meg (8:55:27 PM):  lol
amy (8:55:30 PM):  did it drop bc cars got too expensive?
meg (8:55:41 PM):  Big cars did
michael (8:55:49 PM):  Hmm: "In 2008 rapidly rising gas prices resulted in a 30% drop off of sales of SUVs which had been GM's most profitable product."
michael (8:55:57 PM):  That's for a particularly type of car, though.
michael (8:56:03 PM):  From the wiki page.
george (8:56:21 PM):  hehe
michael (8:56:22 PM):  Still, if you have a factory built for SUVs, you can't change that easily.
michelle (8:56:30 PM):  I heard India has been developing $1000 cars
meg (8:56:30 PM):  But SUV's were being sold used everywhere since last summer so everyone was trying to get rid of theirs
amy (8:56:35 PM):  true
george (8:56:44 PM):  you probably wouldn't ever have to parallel park again
meg (8:56:47 PM):  That would be awesome
meg (8:57:00 PM):  Yeah just pull into the smallest spot ever
meg (8:57:01 PM):  lol
amy (8:57:04 PM):  michelle- to sell where?
meg (8:57:08 PM):  I want a $1000 car!
george (8:57:23 PM):  SUV is a bad business model tho...that's like Hollywood videos getting wiped out by netflix and redbox
meg (8:57:32 PM):  'The 2009 Hyundai Accent ranks 16 out of 35 Affordable Small Cars.'
amy (8:57:40 PM):  i love redbox
meg (8:57:43 PM):  Dang I want them now
amy (8:57:48 PM):  but ya know whats even better than redb
meg (8:57:48 PM):  I do too
michael (8:57:49 PM):  I heard of an Indian company that was using compressed air for fuel as well. That sounded neat.
george (8:58:04 PM):  i've actually seen a few smart cars on campus
meg (8:58:07 PM):  That would be really good for emissions
amy (8:58:10 PM):  the library!  some branches have SO many movies and pretty noew too
meg (8:58:12 PM):  I have too
meg (8:58:16 PM):  I love the library
meg (8:58:25 PM):  Wow nerd alert.
meg (8:58:27 PM):  :-P
george (8:58:30 PM):  ooh what are top 3 small cars?
amy (8:58:35 PM):  totally!  love it!
amy (8:58:41 PM):  free stuff all the time!
amy (8:58:56 PM):  to borrow though of course
meg (8:59:03 PM):  1)honda fit, 2)civic and 3) civic hybrid
george (8:59:03 PM):  let me guess amy- bit torrent?
michael (8:59:07 PM):  You mean what are top 3 top selling small cars?
meg (8:59:12 PM):  link
michael (8:59:25 PM):  Oh, I see.
amy (8:59:30 PM):  whats that george?
meg (8:59:47 PM):  hahaha
meg (8:59:52 PM):  Its free stuff online
michelle (8:59:54 PM):  in terms of price, 1 lessthan 2 lessthan 3. meg?
meg (9:00:02 PM):  link
michael (9:00:13 PM):  She was talking about libraries, george. ^^
meg (9:00:42 PM):  Yeah michelle
amy (9:00:44 PM):  i have no idea what that site is-  never saw it before
meg (9:00:50 PM):  I think it also has to do with cost of ownership
amy (9:00:54 PM):  ohhh free stuff online
meg (9:00:57 PM):  Downloading
george (9:01:08 PM):  bit torrent?  that is a peer-to-peer "file sharing" system
george (9:01:33 PM):  oh haha
amy (9:01:33 PM):  hmm i dont know about that
michael (9:01:38 PM):  So the big 3 aren't making the top cars, I guess.
meg (9:02:00 PM):  Yeah but they're all honda
meg (9:02:05 PM):  Which makes me think
meg (9:02:11 PM):  my mom got a 2008 honda civic
meg (9:02:21 PM):  she loves it
michael (9:02:29 PM):  I see a Ford way down there, at least, ha.
george (9:02:46 PM):  maybe honda runs the website ;-*(
michael (9:02:53 PM):  They were doing better than the other two back during the bailout hearings.
meg (9:02:56 PM):  hahaha
george (9:03:11 PM):  go ford!
george (9:03:14 PM):  lol
michael (9:03:26 PM):  Hmm, "Rankings based on an in-depth analysis by U.S. News editors of all published auto ratings, reviews and test drives."
meg (9:03:57 PM):  nice
meg (9:04:03 PM):  So relatively reliable?
meg (9:04:13 PM):  My uncle used to work for ford
meg (9:04:18 PM):  but then got a job somewhere else
michael (9:04:20 PM):  Hmm, who knows how they did their analysis, though.
meg (9:04:26 PM):  Or else I'd got to him for a sweet deal
michael (9:04:27 PM):  You can't really argue with a sales figure ranking, etc..
amy (9:04:30 PM):  buying a new car is like playing the lotto-  sometimes you're happy, sometimes you're not
meg (9:04:44 PM):  I know
meg (9:04:49 PM):  but I want to be happy
meg (9:04:53 PM):  so I'm researching
meg (9:04:54 PM):  lol
amy (9:05:18 PM):  i spent months researching new cars...i ended up getting something i'm really comfortable with within my price range...of course it has its cons but it was the right car for me to buy
meg (9:06:00 PM):  Months!
meg (9:06:03 PM):  Oh mann
meg (9:06:08 PM):  I was going to get one this summer
amy (9:06:09 PM):  yup!
meg (9:06:14 PM):  Lol
amy (9:06:27 PM):  got what i wanted though and didnt jump on a deal right away
amy (9:06:40 PM):  sounds like you've been looking though so you got a good start already
michael (9:06:43 PM):  Did you go for a small one or a big one?
meg (9:06:58 PM):  Small
amy (9:07:05 PM):  checy malibu   family size i think
meg (9:07:06 PM):  for me
meg (9:07:09 PM):  thats what I want
amy (9:07:24 PM):  its like the camry   (but better!)  hehe
meg (9:08:17 PM):  My first car was a camry
amy (9:08:25 PM):  mine too!!
amy (9:08:28 PM):  '86
meg (9:08:33 PM):  An '87 with 33k on it when I got it in '04
george (9:08:51 PM):  so no mustangs for you guys?
meg (9:08:51 PM):  It lasted til Dec '07
amy (9:09:03 PM):  ohh our cars were simnilar i bet!  i loved it bc it was the highest model of the day-   i got it in '99 though
meg (9:09:05 PM):  We put 100k on it between me and my sis in 3 years!
meg (9:09:07 PM):  Hah
amy (9:09:08 PM):  not bad
george (9:09:09 PM):  get a little muscle under the hood
michael (9:09:15 PM):  Hehe, I wonder how sports car sales were affected.
meg (9:09:16 PM):  Mustangs are a bit too expensive
michael (9:09:22 PM):  I guess mpg isn't as much of an issue there.
meg (9:09:23 PM):  Lol
amy (9:09:40 PM):  like which cars?
meg (9:09:53 PM):  I mean if I had no problem with money I'd go for a audi
meg (9:09:56 PM):  TT
meg (9:10:01 PM):  I looove them
meg (9:10:07 PM):  Convertible hard top
michael (9:10:10 PM):  And rich are less affefcted by the recession maybe?
george (9:10:21 PM):  that'd be interesting if sports cars sales werent' hurt
george (9:10:36 PM):  resounding statement of who's hurting and who's not :o
amy (9:10:36 PM):  i see a lot of motorcycles on the road-  maybe i just notice them now though
meg (9:10:42 PM):  Amen
meg (9:10:55 PM):  they come out for a couple months
meg (9:11:02 PM):  I was home last weekend and everyone was out
meg (9:11:12 PM):  its a biiiiig motorcycle area in Dutchess county
michael (9:11:20 PM):  Even ignoring the dependency on SUVs and trucks for profity, the American makers were getting a bad rep. for quality too, though.
michael (9:11:30 PM):  Thay will hurt sales of all types.
michael (9:12:01 PM):  Yeah, motorcycles become much more common when the weather is nice.
amy (9:12:09 PM):  i always heard that growing up-  dont buy american cars
michael (9:12:11 PM):  Although they have good gas mileage too, don't they?
meg (9:12:17 PM):  me too
meg (9:12:28 PM):  But they're not good for long distance
meg (9:12:34 PM):  (cycles)
george (9:13:08 PM):  my friend is crazy...he is a new home buyer and wants to use the tax credit to buy a motorcycle
meg (9:13:25 PM):  That's funny
george (9:13:30 PM):  with a new daughter on the way in about a month :o
meg (9:13:33 PM):  Instead of putting it back into the morgtage?
michael (9:13:39 PM):  Funny I don't see many references to motorcycle sales re the economy and whatnot, maybe they just aren't a big part of the market.
george (9:13:45 PM):  yea or buying furnature
george (9:13:57 PM):  furniture (sp)
michael (9:14:16 PM):  I'd be even more worried with him dying riding the thing than wasting the money...
meg (9:14:19 PM):  lol
george (9:14:38 PM):  yea there's the safety factor as well
michael (9:14:45 PM):  Get yourself killed OK, but with a baby coming that needs you?
george (9:14:57 PM):  in addition, there's a good portion of the year where motorcycle riding is very unpleasant to say the least
meg (9:15:07 PM):  amen
meg (9:15:18 PM):  I saw the WORST motorcycle accident
meg (9:15:26 PM):  and it made me never want to ride one
george (9:15:27 PM):  and...he doesn't have a car lol
meg (9:15:35 PM):  haha!
george (9:15:37 PM):  i better talk some sense into him come to think of it lol
meg (9:15:46 PM):  Sounds like it
meg (9:16:29 PM):  So its between the accent and fit I think
amy (9:16:32 PM):  sorry guiys- stepped away for a second.....
george (9:16:39 PM):  another friend almost broke his engagement by buying a  bike
meg (9:16:39 PM):  s'ok
amy (9:16:52 PM):  isnt that tax credit something to be weary of though??  someone said something about it coming back to hurt you later??
meg (9:16:54 PM):  I want to ride one, but I think only once
amy (9:17:09 PM):  (fine print)
george (9:17:42 PM):  not sure how that works...i didn't read too much about it since i'm not buying a home
amy (9:18:07 PM):  me neither- but i def heard something somewhere (like all my "some"things?  lol)
george (9:18:08 PM):  as far as i know, it is just a check for several grand to new home buyers
meg (9:18:13 PM):  probably not a good think considering how good the economy is and how good the govt is about protecting homeowners
meg (9:18:28 PM):  *thing
george (9:18:44 PM):  i agree...gov't has lost its mind with throwing money at this and that
george (9:18:59 PM):  home prices come down, more people will buy because it will be affordable
meg (9:19:11 PM):  I wouldn't say no to winning the lotto right now
meg (9:19:24 PM):  pretty sure everyone would be happy with it too
george (9:19:49 PM):  if everybody wins the lotto we'll each get $1?  lol
michael (9:20:00 PM):  Wow, here's an odd comment: "In 2008, the situation became critical because the global financial crisis and the related credit crunch placed pressure on the prices of raw materials."
meg (9:20:08 PM):  well everyone i'm friends with
michael (9:20:09 PM):  What does credit have to do with raw materials?
meg (9:20:13 PM):  ouch
george (9:20:27 PM):  which includes me, right meg?  ;-)
meg (9:20:33 PM):  no one can pay for the stuff they're buying
amy (9:20:33 PM):  i dont know
meg (9:20:36 PM):  haha sure:D
amy (9:21:11 PM):  i thought raw materials went up in price bc of gasr prices (transportating goods)
michael (9:21:16 PM):  Ah, give me the money for the material, I'll pay you back later when I sell the car sort of thing?
meg (9:21:43 PM):  well does that include food?
michael (9:21:44 PM):  gas and oil prices going up would make all industry more expensive as well
meg (9:22:29 PM):  gas sucked for me this past summer
michael (9:22:35 PM):  I heard aluminum particularly takes a lot of energy to produce, for example.
meg (9:22:43 PM):  I spent over $100 everytime I filled my tank
meg (9:22:55 PM):  $5 got me nowhere
meg (9:22:59 PM):  :(
meg (9:23:05 PM):  I learned from that
meg (9:23:12 PM):  Small car!
michael (9:23:15 PM):  It's been down lately, though.
amy (9:23:23 PM):  my friends and i reminisced about the time when we could fill the tank up for $5 just to go out on a friday night!  It was great!
meg (9:23:53 PM):  Yeah but no guarantee it will stay down
george (9:24:43 PM):  get about 2 gallons for $5 now
meg (9:25:04 PM):  If I could afford it i'd go hybrid
michael (9:25:08 PM):  Yeah, not like you can trade in your car suddenly when the gas prices change.
amy (9:25:27 PM):  but i thinkwe've had the best gas prices in the country though-  europe has paid higher always
michael (9:25:31 PM):  I did see a mention for some car makers accepting cars back if the buyer loses their job, though.
amy (9:25:38 PM):  * in the world
meg (9:25:46 PM):  Honda does that
george (9:25:47 PM):  from what i've read, our global oil supply is running out as well
michael (9:25:53 PM):  Pretty creative way to try to get people feeling secure about buying.
michael (9:26:27 PM):  Is the high price in Europe due to taxes there?
amy (9:26:40 PM):  then we better get moving on our electric car, etc
george (9:26:44 PM):  yes
meg (9:26:59 PM):  They also go by liters
meg (9:27:07 PM):  In the UK at least
michael (9:27:24 PM):  I've heard Europe in general spends a lot more government money on mass transit and things like that too.
amy (9:27:40 PM):  um health care
george (9:27:48 PM):  UK used to be a next exporter of oil, their oil reserves in the north sea are drying up...soon they will be an importer :o
michael (9:27:51 PM):  High gas taxes and that, guess they've been discouraging car use, actually.
amy (9:27:57 PM):  sorry that just slipped out
george (9:28:24 PM):  amy = turrets!
amy (9:28:26 PM):  there are a LOT of bikes in europe
amy (9:28:55 PM):  i almost got run over by one in netherlands-  ok he screamed at me and rang his little bell til i moved!
meg (9:28:57 PM):  I'd get a bike if I could actually live without a car
george (9:29:08 PM):  those little mopeds are kind of cool but i'd feel a bit uncomfortable on one of those on the highway
amy (9:29:11 PM):  i'd get a bike to go places if there were sidewalks!
amy (9:29:31 PM):  yeah the moped thing only works if the majority of others are using them too i think'
meg (9:30:10 PM):  Hahaha mopeds amke me think of Eddie izzard
meg (9:30:12 PM):  Ciao
amy (9:30:20 PM):  my friend is from spain and he rides his bike to many places around albany-  he almost got hit by someone once and he actually followed them to the parking lot and said that he thought that was rude what they did to him   LOL
george (9:30:30 PM):  lol
meg (9:30:39 PM):  Good
meg (9:30:45 PM):  people don't care about bike riders
meg (9:30:55 PM):  and they should!
amy (9:30:57 PM):  i was like  you could have gottten hurt by cofronting them   he said, well they almost killed me!
george (9:31:11 PM):  lol i curse at bike riders when i'm driving
meg (9:31:40 PM):  I do too
meg (9:31:41 PM):  lol
amy (9:31:41 PM):  see its our culture-  the culture elsewhere thinks cars are dumb (some places)
michael (9:31:44 PM):  It can be rough sometimes, though, driving to work and being stuck behind a bicyclist. It would be nice if they had their own lanes...
meg (9:31:46 PM):  but I don't hit them
george (9:32:00 PM):  when there's barely enough room for 2 lanes and a biker is holding me up makes me want to choke them
meg (9:32:03 PM):  on parts of Western they do
meg (9:32:13 PM):  lol
amy (9:32:30 PM):  western is where pedestrians and bikers get hit
meg (9:32:33 PM):  I have road rage too sometimes
meg (9:32:35 PM):  I know
meg (9:32:37 PM):  :(
meg (9:32:52 PM):  There's 2 bikes right next to the synoco before campus
amy (9:32:58 PM):  remember that older woman hit on he bike like last year?
george (9:33:12 PM):  i wonder if there's any correlation between size of car you're driving and amount of road rage
meg (9:33:18 PM):  yeah
amy (9:33:24 PM):  its just not possible to ride a bike anywhere but a park in the USA
meg (9:33:26 PM):  probably not
george (9:33:28 PM):  seems harder to get road rage in a smart car for some reason
amy (9:33:39 PM):  ooh george-  i like that topic
amy (9:33:43 PM):  its true!
amy (9:34:00 PM):  suvs think they own the northway!
meg (9:34:07 PM):  i guess it has gotten bigger since i've gotten the minivan
amy (9:34:18 PM):  get the fit meg
meg (9:34:21 PM):  although people get pissed if they see a minivan passing them on the highway
amy (9:34:21 PM):  lol
meg (9:34:26 PM):  LOL
meg (9:34:48 PM):  I just yell at them from the safety of my car
michael (9:34:48 PM):  Hmm, found some better reasons for how the credit crunch could affect the auto industry better: "GM was unable to obtain credit to buy Chrysler. Sales fell further as consumer credit tightened and it became much harder for people with average or poor credit to obtain a bank loan to buy a car. "
amy (9:35:09 PM):  minivans are the safest vehicles on the road i read
michael (9:35:10 PM):  Most people do buy cars using financing, I guess.
meg (9:35:14 PM):  avg credit= me
meg (9:35:31 PM):  its true is they're driven by mom's not by 20-somethings
meg (9:35:51 PM):  *if
george (9:36:09 PM):  merging GM and Chrysler is basically taking two failing companies and making one big failure
michael (9:36:15 PM):  Well safety can be due to the body being made in one piece too....unibody construction.
amy (9:36:15 PM):  so it wasnt just the car companies structure?  it was the structure of homebuying, etc
michael (9:36:52 PM):  That's a good point, I wonder why GM wanted to buy Chrysler...
meg (9:37:15 PM):  From what I read Chrysler had a couple of plans but the people who wouldn't finance were their hedge fund holders
george (9:37:22 PM):  well, i don't think bank of america wanted to buy merril lynch
meg (9:37:23 PM):  which is completely ridiculous to me
george (9:37:32 PM):  might have been like that
michael (9:37:47 PM):  Maybe they could merge brands or something, make them on the same lines, but still get increased sales?
meg (9:38:23 PM):  it's like trying to get off a sinking ship by getting on one thats headed for an iceberg though
meg (9:38:32 PM):  you're still going to drown
michael (9:38:37 PM):  Oh, actual plans would be much nicer than begging for money, heh.
meg (9:38:48 PM):  i'm a debbie downer sorry
george (9:39:07 PM):  lol, their plans were to get financing to beg for money
meg (9:39:39 PM):  maybe i'll wait until the economy starts to rebound before buying a car
amy (9:40:05 PM):  when is the hybrid going to become common i wonder
amy (9:40:23 PM):  when i went to a car show 2 yrs ago, they said they were still working things out with them
meg (9:40:24 PM):  I've seen them around campus a lot
meg (9:40:28 PM):  they look nice
meg (9:40:38 PM):  and by them i mean like 2
george (9:40:41 PM):  prius is pretty mainstream now
michael (9:40:44 PM):  The new plug in ones are supposed to save a lot more money than the earlier ones, aren't they?
meg (9:41:09 PM):  My old room mate got the prius
amy (9:41:13 PM):  with all the "green" talk going around, i wonder why this isnt catching on...or why they havent worked out the kinks yet
meg (9:41:13 PM):  its a nice car
michael (9:41:17 PM):  Use cheap electric from the grid when you can, don't always make it in the car.
amy (9:41:57 PM):  i wanted to buy one when i was looking but just want confident in it
meg (9:42:02 PM):  because its still not affordable
amy (9:42:05 PM):  *wasnt
amy (9:42:14 PM):  good point
meg (9:42:16 PM):  the honda civic hybrid is $27k
michael (9:42:18 PM):  Trying to get out the next big innovation for hybrids would have been good for the American industry, I guess.
amy (9:42:25 PM):  really?
michael (9:42:35 PM):  That would have taken spending more money on their part, though? Tough to do when failing.
meg (9:42:36 PM):  I mean I'd like to pay off my car before I'm retired
amy (9:43:28 PM):  the weird thing is happening again
meg (9:43:34 PM):  what?
michael (9:43:46 PM):  Screen flicker?
amy (9:43:52 PM):  things people said a while ago reappeared on my screen
meg (9:43:53 PM):  is yours jumping everytime someone talks back to something that was already said
meg (9:43:55 PM):  me too
amy (9:44:03 PM):  yes
george (9:44:30 PM):  hmm
meg (9:44:38 PM):  What do you guys think though- between the fit and the accent?
meg (9:44:41 PM):  I like them both
michael (9:44:41 PM):  Oh, yeah I see it too....looks kind of like it refills the entire window with the whole conversation each time.
george (9:44:44 PM):  working the same for me
michael (9:44:52 PM):  So a long conversation takes a long time to fill the window.
george (9:45:00 PM):  i haven't tried the fit but accent has been very reliable so far for me
meg (9:45:01 PM):  yeah
meg (9:45:04 PM):  exactly
meg (9:45:10 PM):  What yr?
george (9:45:22 PM):  i'd love to test drive the fit actually
meg (9:46:04 PM):  its a nice car
amy (9:46:17 PM):  meg def go test drive the ones in your price range and just make comparisons.  you'll figure it all out  : )
meg (9:46:18 PM):  and even thuogh its small there's more room inside than you think there will be
meg (9:47:09 PM):  I will
meg (9:47:17 PM):  lol as long as i leave my road rage at home
amy (9:47:21 PM):  link  i liked this site when i was looking
amy (9:47:45 PM):  read the customer reviews
meg (9:47:58 PM):  i will
michael (9:48:34 PM):  Wow, here's an odd comment....automakers trying to raise prices: "promotional strategies, including rebates, employee pricing and 0% financing, have boosted sales but have also cut into profits. More importantly such promotions drain the automaker's cash reserves in the near term while in the long run the company suffers the stigma of selling vehicles because of low price instead of technical merit. Automakers have since been trying to scale back on incentives and raise prices, while cutting production."
meg (9:48:56 PM):  thats bad
michael (9:48:57 PM):  We started off talking about them lowering prices, I think.
meg (9:49:10 PM):  i mean, if they want people to buy its a good strategy
meg (9:49:19 PM):  but thats just a vicious cycle
meg (9:49:36 PM):  lowering prices to get people to buy and end up in bankruptcies
meg (9:50:07 PM):  Alright eveyone
michael (9:50:09 PM):  And getting known for selling cheap products instead of quality ones, heh. Never thought of that.
meg (9:50:12 PM):  looks like its time to go
george (9:50:41 PM):  yup, good talking with you
amy (9:50:47 PM):  thanks for sharing the quotes michael-  it helped
michael (9:50:48 PM):  Ay, yep. Good night everyone.
george (9:50:49 PM):  night guys!
meg (9:50:52 PM):  You too:D see you next time
amy (9:51:01 PM):  night everyone-  enjoy your friday
michael (9:51:19 PM):  Too bad we didn't have an economics major in the house.

vincent (1:03:25 PM):  Hi mara.
mara (1:03:26 PM):  hi vincent
mara (1:03:28 PM):  ha
vincent (1:03:38 PM):  I'm at a spot w/ slow connection, took me forever to log in.
vincent (1:03:43 PM):  where is everyone?
mara (1:04:06 PM):  oh that's too bad
rachael (1:04:10 PM):  Well, one more person is here.
mara (1:04:12 PM):  im not sure... Hi rachael
rachael (1:04:26 PM):  Hi folks!
vincent (1:04:44 PM):  hey rachael, how's it going?
mara (1:05:00 PM):  moderator sent me an e-mail about being the discussion leader today
vincent (1:05:14 PM):  cool... lead the way.
vincent (1:05:32 PM):  should we wait for a few more?
rachael (1:05:32 PM):  Well, I've been doing errands.  I'm not sure what our topic is for today. Oh, I see mara knows.
mara (1:05:33 PM):  anyone want to pose topics? we can start with us and if people come in they can just join in... we can fill them in
vincent (1:06:28 PM):  Hm, I'm up for anything.  (it's 10am out here, I just woke up!)
mara (1:06:38 PM):  nice!
rachael (1:07:07 PM):  Where's "out here?"
mara (1:07:07 PM):  well are you guys into pop culture at all... its been all over the news about chris brown and rhianna
vincent (1:07:28 PM):  I'm a West Coaster... I live in Seattle, but I'm currently in Oakland, CA
mara (1:07:31 PM):  i thought we could start there if you are interested, and maybe do more about tabloids and stuff
vincent (1:07:51 PM):  sure... I don't know too much about celebrities, but I'm pretty into hip-hop, so I know this particular story
rachael (1:08:10 PM):  I avoided reading about that story.  Sounded too sad and sordid.
vincent (1:08:30 PM):  Yeah... she got back together with him?  that's the last I heard.
mara (1:08:59 PM):  yeah did you hear about the convention that diddy did for them
mara (1:09:01 PM):  ?
vincent (1:09:07 PM):  convention?
mara (1:09:37 PM):  yeah he invited them both to his house and then helped them talk through it
vincent (1:09:39 PM):  I guess not.
mara (1:09:49 PM):  i guess JayZ was pretty upset about Diddy doing that
mara (1:10:10 PM):  I thought you might know the connections thats all vincent.  they are all very close in this industry
vincent (1:10:19 PM):  Jay-Z thought she should leave him?
mara (1:10:46 PM):  rachael, what stories do you read about?
mara (1:11:26 PM):  im not sure what JayZ thought about the hole thing
vincent (1:11:51 PM):  I just did a quick google, he called CB a "walking dead man"
mara (1:11:52 PM):  i guess hes just not a big fan of abuse in relationships and didnt think they needed to resolve this yet
mara (1:12:15 PM):  see thing are crazy
vincent (1:12:29 PM):  I also just downloaded this Ghostface (from Wu-Tang) song called "message from ghost" that's pro-Rhianna
mara (1:12:39 PM):  i mean people have completely stopped playing his music... most of the mainstream channels anyway
mara (1:13:09 PM):  So what do you think about the effects of this sort of news..?
vincent (1:13:19 PM):  blacklist, that's intense.  and cool that people would stop playing money-making stuff on a principle.  you don't get that in the music industry much
rachael (1:13:25 PM):  Not these, I'm afraid.  As I said, sad and sordid.  I had the impression that an abusive relationship was being made into hot news, when the emphasis should be on the total unacceptability of abuse.
mara (1:13:40 PM):  I just cant help but think about all the women in America that this happens to, but only the ones who get reported on get any attention
vincent (1:14:04 PM):  I hear that, the conversation become more about the celebrities than the themes or issues.
vincent (1:14:17 PM):  *becomes
mara (1:14:30 PM):  i agree rachael.  If you look into the past you can start to see a sort of sequence with this abuse and the news... Tina Turner
rachael (1:14:47 PM):  That's true.  But the attention in this message in this case didbn't seem to be what I would expect: get away and get help.  And stay away.
mara (1:15:18 PM):  hmm well I think conflict resolution is much more difficult
mara (1:15:22 PM):  "she loves him"
vincent (1:15:46 PM):  more difficult than leaving?
mara (1:16:01 PM):  yeah i guess
rachael (1:16:04 PM):  How can there be love in an abusive relationship?  Dependency, maybe.
vincent (1:16:17 PM):  probably in some senses harder, yeah, but it sort of doesn't "punish" the behavior
vincent (1:16:42 PM):  the message to the abuser is "do what you want, then say you're sorry and you'll be fine"
mara (1:17:12 PM):  I htink that many women have it instilled in them that "it wont happen to me" "if it does, I must have done something to provoke it, push his buttons"
rachael (1:17:38 PM):  I have read that someone manipulative enough to maintain in which she/he is abusive is also manipulatuve enough to make it through any number of reconciliation sessions with the requisite numbers of "Baby, I'm sorrys..."
mara (1:17:54 PM):  i agree vincent, but is this because of the woman's role in the relationship that this sort of thing happens
rachael (1:18:06 PM):  Sorry; I left out "a relationsuip" after "maintain."
mara (1:19:05 PM):  i can see that being true thats for sure
vincent (1:19:08 PM):  I guess the traditional role, yes.  Like if you think about how, traditionally, women are supposed to "clean up messes," ...take that further, to psychological messes, etc, and she's just supposed to sort of wipe that away
rachael (1:19:48 PM):  Sorry about the typing errors.  There is a book called, I think, Why Does He Do That? about abusive relationships.  Ithink.  Not much chance of change.
vincent (1:20:01 PM):  statistically?
mara (1:20:01 PM):  right, i think thats close enough to what research shows
rachael (1:20:49 PM):  "It's my fault because I made him angry.
rachael (1:21:01 PM):  That always worries me.
vincent (1:21:18 PM):  yeah, that's the only "rational" explanation for a totally irrational situation... it must be me
mara (1:21:22 PM):  so what are the implications on society when we read "sad stories" like this abusive one with Rhianna and Chris Brown... we see them working it out and getting back together.. What does this teach us
vincent (1:21:34 PM):  if you try to make sense of it it just won't, so you force the blame on yourself...
rachael (1:21:53 PM):  It teaches us about the path to OJ and Nicole!
vincent (1:21:55 PM):  I don't know... how different is this from other similar stories?
mara (1:21:58 PM):  i can help but think it furthers this sequence and adds to women wanting to work things out, or thinking they should yaknow?
vincent (1:22:01 PM):  good
vincent (1:22:21 PM):  yeah, like maybe it could be even spun as weirdly romantic?
vincent (1:22:36 PM):  I meant good OJ joke
rachael (1:22:39 PM):  Is it different from similar stories?  I really didn't follow it.
mara (1:23:13 PM):  im not sure... i think there is toomuch left out of it to be honest
vincent (1:23:27 PM):  hm "be like this cool famous singer and stay with your abusive boyfriend" ?
mara (1:23:41 PM):  i just feel if hollywood is going to talk about these things, they need to give more information because it can be very misleading to us
rachael (1:23:55 PM):  I understand that the danger of thinking it romantic is especially appealing (and threatening) to teenagers.
vincent (1:24:32 PM):  totally, I mean suicidal infatuation (romeo and juliet) is supposed to be the most romantic thing ever.
mara (1:24:45 PM):  wow, we are going as far as to say it can be romantic now, in that weird sort of way?
rachael (1:24:51 PM):  Not much future in it.
vincent (1:24:59 PM):  I think it could be spun that way, in the stories.
mara (1:25:22 PM):  hmm... i find that very interesting
mara (1:26:14 PM):  how about those choking games that teenage boys are known to play?
vincent (1:26:20 PM):  Hollywood has romanticized suicide, murder, heroin, etc... I wouldn't be surprised.
rachael (1:26:20 PM):  I can't see enobling abuse by thinking of it as romantic in any way.
rachael (1:27:17 PM):  That's a conversation stopper.
vincent (1:27:30 PM):  it's pretty heavy
vincent (1:27:54 PM):  choking games? like when the pass out?
vincent (1:27:57 PM):  they
mara (1:28:39 PM):  yeah, that's my point I feel like if abuse is this made to be the way vincent talks about it, maybe it has effects on boys and girls the same
mara (1:29:22 PM):  those games, as far as i know, can be used to relieve sexual frustrations, much like cutting does for some
vincent (1:29:34 PM):  possibly... or like that show Jackass where a group of friends just beat each other up
vincent (1:29:38 PM):  beats
mara (1:30:19 PM):  yeah what is it that is so entertaining about that show anyway?
vincent (1:30:54 PM):  I don't know at all... I've seen bits of it that I laughed at, but then I felt bad for laughing.
mara (1:31:06 PM):  i mean I watched the movie, but i didnt laugh nearly as many times as the people in the theater did
mara (1:31:38 PM):  what about movies like "The Ringer"? Are you guys familiar?
vincent (1:31:49 PM):  yeah.  I mean a lot of that stuff and Reality tv is like watching people go through painful stuff... is it like the new version of the Colleseum? watching gladiators?
rachael (1:31:49 PM):  No
vincent (1:31:56 PM):  I don't know the Ringer?
vincent (1:32:30 PM):  what is it?
mara (1:32:45 PM):  its a movie where a man pretends to be "differently abled" and gets into the special olympics
mara (1:33:07 PM):  then basically he wins the whole thing because hes really not disabled at all... just plays it off like that
vincent (1:33:11 PM):  ouch.
mara (1:33:59 PM):  yeah what gives hollywood the right to make films about these things... they are sensitive to some
vincent (1:34:07 PM):  that's very much Jackass humor
vincent (1:34:49 PM):  yeah, once you get near the good taste vs. freedom of speech thing, it gets really tricky
mara (1:34:54 PM):  i think the actor that plays the fake in this movie is one of the guys from jackass actually
rachael (1:35:13 PM):  Well, they have the right to make movies about anything.  If people buy tickets, they're voting for the movie.
vincent (1:35:24 PM):  right.
mara (1:35:54 PM):  oh ofcourse, but to make things like that humorous... i just have a hard time dealing i guess
vincent (1:35:58 PM):  the question is what producer was like, "I think this movie will be popular" and what people are actually making that a true prediction
mara (1:36:17 PM):  exactly
mara (1:37:29 PM):  so rachael what you want to talk about?
vincent (1:37:37 PM):  it's somehow something a lot of people see, the plot summary, and think "yeah!  I get this!"... weird.
mara (1:38:21 PM):  what kinda of movies do you guys watch?
vincent (1:38:24 PM):  yeah, how you doing, rachael?
mara (1:38:34 PM):  lol
rachael (1:38:55 PM):  Ok, just sitting here!  No problem.
vincent (1:39:23 PM):  mara and I were both "here" yesterday... so you're the interesting one!
mara (1:39:31 PM):  well vincent and i kinda met yesterday... as much as this is a meeting haha
mara (1:39:36 PM):  yeah thats what im saying vincent
mara (1:39:45 PM):  whats interesting to you rachael?
mara (1:40:01 PM):  we are already half way through so...
mara (1:40:37 PM):  vincent, how did you find out about this research?
rachael (1:40:53 PM):  It's a little strange.  But I'm involved in a class that causes tenporary insanity, so it's hard to recall too much about news and movies.  I did read about Natasha Richardson a lot.  I was worried about her two young children.
vincent (1:41:12 PM):  My friend Katie who lives in NY used to go to school at SUNY Albany, and she sent it out on Facebook....
vincent (1:41:25 PM):  temporary insanity?
rachael (1:41:59 PM):  I got an email on the IST listserve from SUNY Albany, where I'm taking the class.
mara (1:42:00 PM):  yeah i read about her recently too... very sad situation
vincent (1:42:00 PM):  like they keep you up all night and shoot strobe lights at you?
mara (1:42:14 PM):  haha
vincent (1:43:20 PM):  when people read these logs to study them it's going to be confusing
rachael (1:43:25 PM):  yes, maybe permanent.  It's a class that meets six full Saturdays, which is nice, but the instruction is disorganized and very fast-paced.  The assignments keep changing.  But it's 66.666 % over!
mara (1:43:31 PM):  or that lady that just had the 8 babies and already has 6... OMG
rachael (1:43:55 PM):  Again, that's just too yucky a story to follow.
mara (1:44:12 PM):  welll look on the bright side... what do you study rachael?
mara (1:44:49 PM):  yeah i dont follow it, i just read one article about it and thought "GOOD LUCK MY FELLOW WOMAN"
rachael (1:45:22 PM):  I work at SUNY New Paltz in the School of Education,.  We had to move out of our building for renovation, and my office moved to the library building.  I got so interested I started taking library science courses.
mara (1:45:49 PM):  I love the library!
vincent (1:45:58 PM):  ooh, I used to live in Ithaca, NY, but a couple of my best friends moved to NP.  I used to go there a lot.
mara (1:46:03 PM):  i dont know but about the soft science, but its got to be interesting
vincent (1:46:09 PM):  cute little hippie town
rachael (1:46:18 PM):  IS that your field of study, mara?
mara (1:46:22 PM):  yeah my ex went to Cornell which is in ithica
mara (1:46:37 PM):  i study interpersonal communication
vincent (1:46:41 PM):  yeah, Ithaca is definitely a hippie town too.  I love Ithaca
mara (1:46:53 PM):  but i spend lots and lots of time in the library and i know how to use eery aspect of it
vincent (1:47:03 PM):  have you guys seen stuff about the new Seattle public library?
mara (1:47:06 PM):  its pretty there
mara (1:47:21 PM):  nope!
rachael (1:47:25 PM):  NP's a nice place to work,.  The students are on break now and the town is dead; I can never wait until they come back!
vincent (1:48:03 PM):  we just got the new library a couple years ago.  Rem Koolhas designed this totally crazy building, it's so fun to wander around
vincent (1:48:24 PM):  there's this floor of meeting rooms that kind of looks like you're inside intestines?
mara (1:48:42 PM):  gross, but interesting ha
vincent (1:48:47 PM):  yeah
rachael (1:48:49 PM):  I'll look on  line for the Seattle Public Library.  I was only in Seattle once and my main recollection is all the different manhole covers downtown.  Each one was different, and all the designs were lovely.
mara (1:49:01 PM):  yeah rachael, thats how i feel about being in albany during the summer.. "where is everyone?"
vincent (1:49:12 PM):  yeah! they're cool!  I'm sure there are tons of library photos online
rachael (1:49:46 PM):  Intestines are nice, but the new Ulster County jail has an I-beam through an elevator shaft,.  Can't beat that.
vincent (1:49:59 PM):  does New Paltz still have that, like, 20-year-old mayor?
mara (1:50:00 PM):  i visited spain and they have the nicest libraries EVER
vincent (1:50:18 PM):  Spain is awesome!
mara (1:50:39 PM):  where did you visit in spain?
vincent (1:51:06 PM):  the band I'm in played in Barcelona and Madrid
rachael (1:51:08 PM):  No, I'mnot sure who the mayor is now.  I live in Kingston.  Where did you go in Spain?
vincent (1:51:19 PM):  only two days, but in Barcelona I didn't sleep.
vincent (1:51:25 PM):  what about you?
rachael (1:51:32 PM):  What's the name of your band?  Where else do you play?
mara (1:51:36 PM):  i was in madrid the whole three weeks i was there
mara (1:51:43 PM):  soooo old city i love it
mara (1:52:05 PM):  i didnt sleep much either, it was a great time thats for sure!
vincent (1:52:21 PM):  I'm mostly in a band called The Dead Science, we tour a lot and all over.  In April I'm going to Europe to play for a friend's band.. funny name... Casiotone For The Painfully Alone
vincent (1:52:49 PM):  Spain stays up later than New York!
rachael (1:52:55 PM):  Are you a gang of economists?
vincent (1:53:08 PM):  ha!
mara (1:53:15 PM):  lol
vincent (1:53:30 PM):  that's a way funnier answer than mine, I usually say Alchemy.
rachael (1:53:43 PM):  Where are you going to play with the CTone Painfully Alone?
mara (1:54:12 PM):  indie rock?
vincent (1:54:29 PM):  All over the U.K., Scandanavia (!), and central Europe (france, germany, netherlands, austria)
vincent (1:54:40 PM):  no Spain or Italy this time... yeah indie rock
mara (1:54:59 PM):  you know death cab for cutie?
rachael (1:55:12 PM):  That sounds wonderful.  I've been to Denmark, but not to the rest of Scandinavia.
vincent (1:55:30 PM):  yeah, one or two of those guys I see around at Seattle coffee shops all the time.  Don't know them personally.
vincent (1:55:38 PM):  you were in Copenhagen?
mara (1:55:51 PM):  im going to a concert of theirs in NC middle of april
vincent (1:56:15 PM):  cool!  is that why you're going down?
mara (1:56:52 PM):  no its not... im going to visit a friend but he had tickets and offered to get me one too since I was going to be there
vincent (1:57:03 PM):  in Charlotte?  just a guess.
vincent (1:57:12 PM):  or Chapel Hill?
mara (1:57:27 PM):  Greensboro
vincent (1:57:50 PM):  cool.  We should do a chat that's just about travel one of these times
mara (1:58:13 PM):  well we have about twenty more mins
rachael (1:58:32 PM):  I don't know that band, but all the teenagers I know love it.
vincent (1:58:56 PM):  cool, I've been getting to travel like crazy these last few years on lots of different "levels"... do you guys get to travel much with school and everything?
mara (1:59:04 PM):  yeah rachael, i just heard of them myself, but ive been listening to get familiar with the music and its acutally something im interested in
vincent (1:59:32 PM):  I think Death cab is nice, I think they have pretty well-written lyrics
mara (1:59:34 PM):  my parents never brought me anywhere when i was young so not i get out there whenever i have a change
mara (1:59:37 PM):  chance*
vincent (1:59:53 PM):  whenever you get a change works too
rachael (1:59:55 PM):  Why didn't they bring you anywhere?
vincent (2:00:07 PM):  whenever you save up enough change
mara (2:00:26 PM):  my dad hates going anywhere but home haha my mom can never get him to go on vaca or anything
mara (2:00:40 PM):  they are homebodies... ya know?
vincent (2:00:56 PM):  yeah, my parents travelled a lot when I was little, but now they just chill.
rachael (2:01:06 PM):  My dad was like that too.  My husband is too, unfortunately, but Im working on him.
mara (2:01:15 PM):  boring if you ask me... and its funny whenever i tell my mom Im going somewhere like NC this april... shes like "what are you doing that for?"  Never get is...
mara (2:01:34 PM):  it*
rachael (2:01:47 PM):  I don;t understand her reaction.
vincent (2:01:52 PM):  best is to find out what someone is "into" and then show them that some places have more of the stuff they like than others...
vincent (2:02:09 PM):  whoa, my window just went crazy
vincent (2:02:30 PM):  are you guys here?
rachael (2:02:36 PM):  I wonder what the moderator is thinking.
mara (2:02:39 PM):  yeah!
rachael (2:02:43 PM):  Yes, we're here.
vincent (2:02:56 PM):  okay, better.
mara (2:03:06 PM):  i know i just want them to respond! haha
rachael (2:03:37 PM):  Maybe we could goad them into saying something....
vincent (2:03:56 PM):  originally I thought they were going to try to sneak a robot in here as a person, and see if we notice that they're not real
mara (2:03:59 PM):  yeah good luck
vincent (2:04:15 PM):  I have a computer science roomate, he said people are working on that now
rachael (2:04:26 PM):  That's a good idea, actually,
mara (2:04:38 PM):  they are going to do that but this is the trial run they have to view our chat to see how that robot would have to talk to persuade is ya now
vincent (2:04:47 PM):  right!
mara (2:04:55 PM):  in the next couple weeks they will add him i bet
mara (2:04:57 PM):  or her
mara (2:04:58 PM):  lol
vincent (2:05:00 PM):  they're going to build a hybrid personality out of all of our ideas!
rachael (2:05:05 PM):  Are you serious?
vincent (2:05:24 PM):  they're going to build a hybrid personality out of all of our ideas!
rachael (2:05:32 PM):  That should be interesting!
mara (2:05:48 PM):  im guessing that would be the only way that we wouldnt notice who it was
mara (2:06:10 PM):  right? or else we would all know who the robot was becuase now we are familiar with eachother and the way we chat
mara (2:06:18 PM):  like we discussed yesterday, sort of
vincent (2:06:40 PM):  I don't know enough about it, but if you guys ever have time to kill, look up this guy Ray Kurzweil on wikipedia... he's all into ideas of Artificial Intelligence, and his predictions are totally weird and kind of scary
rachael (2:06:46 PM):  But all these mannerisms could be copied, couldn't they?
rachael (2:07:13 PM):  I'll look up Ray Kurzweil. That sounds interesting
vincent (2:07:18 PM):  they have low-level algorhythms (sp?) where they have canned responses to most of the things they expect people to say
vincent (2:07:40 PM):  I've heard a lot of scammers use them, like those Nigerian bank account scam guys
mara (2:07:59 PM):  oh great way to help ILS out haha
rachael (2:08:06 PM):  How do they work>
vincent (2:08:50 PM):  I don't know... like they know you're going to say "why do you need my account number," and it will know how to answer
vincent (2:09:03 PM):  so they can run lots of different scams at the same time
vincent (2:09:13 PM):  such a weird world
vincent (2:10:14 PM):  what does ILS stand for?
rachael (2:10:23 PM):  But so many of them, like the Nigerian scam letters, sound so obviously stupid, I don't see how anyone could fall for them.
mara (2:10:36 PM):  no idea
rachael (2:10:37 PM):  Information and Library Science.
rachael (2:10:50 PM):  Is that right?
vincent (2:10:50 PM):  nice
vincent (2:11:15 PM):  I know!  but I guess it's so cheap, or free, to send out like a billion letters a day... so if .00001% of people reply, you're still making money
vincent (2:11:37 PM):  it's the same as most spam... it looks so stupid, but they keep doing it, so it must work on someone?
rachael (2:11:52 PM):  True.  Depressing, though, to think anyone would fall for it.
vincent (2:12:29 PM):  yeah, maybe lots of old people who are confused by the internet?
vincent (2:12:32 PM):  sad.
mara (2:12:58 PM):  thats why i have a MAC... hate spam!
rachael (2:13:27 PM):  You have less spam with a MAC?
mara (2:13:29 PM):  no pop-up... not yet at least, someone is soon to figure out how to get change it i bet
mara (2:13:49 PM):  yeah.. no viruses everything is mostly protected
mara (2:13:55 PM):  im sure things will change though, as i said
vincent (2:14:00 PM):  I have a pc, but firefox and lots of anti-spyware programs keep it pretty mellow.
vincent (2:14:30 PM):  I think maybe hackers just haven't targeted macs yet?
mara (2:14:46 PM):  agreeed
rachael (2:14:46 PM):  I don't get pop-ups at home or at work, but I do get a lot of emails from Christian dating services and nursing education   programs.  I wonder who they think I am.
vincent (2:14:52 PM):  Like most things that hackers would want to mess with, institutional stuff, is run off of PCs.
vincent (2:15:13 PM):  Christian dating!
mara (2:15:20 PM):  they are relatively new... but this program wont work on a mac so i had to borrow a lap top from them to participate
vincent (2:15:29 PM):  annoying.
rachael (2:15:57 PM):  Christian mortgages, too.  Creepy.
vincent (2:16:13 PM):  what?  why would christians have different mortgages?
mara (2:16:36 PM):  they are loved by god
mara (2:16:38 PM):  ha
mara (2:16:42 PM):  thats my guess
vincent (2:16:53 PM):  I was just sick and watched a million episodes of 30 Rock in a row, there was something about "plus-size perume"
mara (2:17:00 PM):  but the westboro baptists think differently, thats for sure
rachael (2:17:07 PM):  I think the implication is that you would be dealing with someone honest and compassionate.
vincent (2:17:14 PM):  god loves a sweet mortgage
mara (2:17:16 PM):  lol
rachael (2:17:22 PM):  What's perume?  Perfume?
vincent (2:17:28 PM):  sorry, eys
vincent (2:17:29 PM):  yes
mara (2:17:36 PM):  the smelly spray ya know?
mara (2:17:45 PM):  oh hah sorry it was a typo
mara (2:17:57 PM):  plus-size perfume... what is that exactly?
rachael (2:18:04 PM):  For plus-size people?  That's a weird as Christian mortgages.
vincent (2:18:14 PM):  it was a joke on the show, like why would perfume have to be any different?
mara (2:18:16 PM):  OMG
mara (2:18:36 PM):  oh funny story...
vincent (2:18:38 PM):  marketing joke
rachael (2:18:43 PM):  Maybe it's just a large bottle.
vincent (2:18:56 PM):  yeah!
vincent (2:19:19 PM):  exactly, Christian mortgages are just as funny.  so weird.
mara (2:19:34 PM):  they have this product for your hair called "super skinny" and this heavier set lady came into the salon and was saw it and said "if i take a bath in this will it work for my body"
vincent (2:19:52 PM):  oh no
rachael (2:20:01 PM):  Why would you want skinny hair?
mara (2:20:05 PM):  she had a sense of humor at least
vincent (2:20:15 PM):  maybe if you have dreads?
mara (2:20:25 PM):  its something that you put on before you straighten it
mara (2:20:33 PM):  just makes it very flat and no frizzies
mara (2:20:48 PM):  personally i think it makes my hair oily, greasy GROSS!
rachael (2:21:11 PM):  Since I have straight hair, I could never understand that.
vincent (2:21:51 PM):  are either of you signed up for tomorrow?
mara (2:22:13 PM):  yes sir
mara (2:22:19 PM):  ill be here
rachael (2:22:25 PM):  Yes, I am.  I've done this with kids and a dog running around, so maybe tomorrow will be calmer.
vincent (2:22:37 PM):  oh wow, you didn't let on.
mara (2:23:00 PM):  yeah i was babysitting yesterday its not the easiest task when you have a screaming one around haha
mara (2:23:15 PM):  what about you vincent? you be here
rachael (2:23:22 PM):  That's only because it's typed, not audible.  So you didn't hear me telling everyone to cut it out.
vincent (2:23:36 PM):  yeah, signed up for 1pm.  10am my time.
mara (2:23:38 PM):  lol
mara (2:23:58 PM):  i wish it was that early here i have a lot to do and half the day is gone
rachael (2:24:15 PM):  Still not a word out of the mystery moderator.
mara (2:24:21 PM):  i stayed out too late last night so i was lazy till now
vincent (2:24:30 PM):  we need to provoke them next time.  find out what makes them mad.
rachael (2:24:39 PM):  LOL
vincent (2:24:46 PM):  big Friday night?
mara (2:24:47 PM):  its weird... i signed on this chat at like noon and they were blue... so maybe they really arent on right now
rachael (2:24:54 PM):  Everyone has a weak spot...
mara (2:24:58 PM):  yes too BIG for me
vincent (2:25:11 PM):  I hear that we can "address them" if we have a problem...
mara (2:25:21 PM):  ohhhhh
mara (2:25:46 PM):  well my screen just did what yours did i think vincent
mara (2:25:51 PM):  weird!
vincent (2:25:59 PM):  yeah, it bounced you up to earlier in the conversation?
rachael (2:26:08 PM):  What are your screens doing?  Mine's fine so far.
mara (2:26:27 PM):  yup thats what it did..
rachael (2:26:45 PM):  Odd.
vincent (2:26:51 PM):  weird.
vincent (2:27:08 PM):  okay folks, I'm gonna sign out.  tomorrow?
mara (2:27:13 PM):  i need to shower and get my lazy butt in motions
vincent (2:27:21 PM):  good luck!
mara (2:27:22 PM):  to tomorrow!!!! CHEERS
mara (2:27:24 PM):  haha
rachael (2:27:30 PM):  See you tomorrow.  Not sure how to sign out!
mara (2:27:34 PM):  have  a good day ill miss you
mara (2:27:34 PM):  haha
vincent (2:27:47 PM):  just close the window, then it takes you to a survey
mara (2:27:47 PM):  just X out
vincent (2:27:52 PM):  ha
rachael (2:27:54 PM):  Thanks!
vincent (2:27:54 PM):  bye!
mara (2:28:00 PM):  ok bye bye

michael (8:16:24 PM):  Hello.
amy (8:20:05 PM):  Hello!
george (8:20:21 PM):  good evening
michael (8:20:24 PM):  Hi
michael (8:21:13 PM):  Sarah's name has been going between blue and gray on my screen...maybe she is working through some computer problems?
amy (8:21:47 PM):  An email just came in from meg that she won't be here on time
george (8:22:28 PM):  we get to hire someone else tonight!
amy (8:22:32 PM):  that leaves mara and Yuan possibly coming later also
michael (8:22:38 PM):  Oh, hope she finds the cat.
amy (8:23:02 PM):  Hi nick
michael (8:23:13 PM):  george: yeah, a lot of them snuck in that computer skills info again tonight, though.
george (8:23:35 PM):  haha
george (8:24:09 PM):  7 to 14 year olds need plenty of computer counseling
amy (8:24:12 PM):  yeah, in another job that requires People Skills!
amy (8:24:33 PM):  thats true george- a benefit
george (8:25:02 PM):  who knows...perhaps they need help with their spread sheets near income tax time!
michael (8:25:16 PM):  Actually a computer expert at the Y would be nice...I tried to change my address to one outside Albany the other day but the guy at the desk said the computer system refused the zip code, heh.
amy (8:25:42 PM):  hehe
amy (8:26:11 PM):  i think the job descrip is lacking tonight
amy (8:26:32 PM):  itdoesnt ally say what you'd be doing-  counselor, etc.  Just says working with 7-14
michael (8:26:45 PM):  Yeah, would be nice if it said they are managing an after school class or sitting in an office to counsel youth with problems or what....
amy (8:27:19 PM):  shall we assume it means working directly with that age group opposed to working just a desk type?
george (8:27:31 PM):  perhaps by multi-task they mean do multiple tasks?  :o
george (8:27:52 PM):  like a multi-purpose job; whatever needs to get done?
george (8:28:05 PM):  yea, it is a strange description
michael (8:28:32 PM):  Man the desk today, plan a kids program for the summer the next day, handle a program in person the next? I could see that, I guess.
amy (8:29:13 PM):  communication skills, be outgoing and a self-starter and able to multi-task       well, how bout we based the resumes on these qualities they are looking for....
george (8:29:23 PM):  so we prefer experience filling an unspecific ambiguous role!
michael (8:29:27 PM):  A lot of the staffers at the Y seem to do both training in the weight rooms and regular job stuff from what I've seen.
amy (8:29:28 PM):  and work with kids of course
michael (8:29:56 PM):  Not sure who handles those more community oriented rooms with computers and meeting tables and the kitchen and whatnot in the back, though.
amy (8:30:17 PM):  but there are camps run out of Ys also and child care
amy (8:30:37 PM):  hello?   everyones names just disappeared...
george (8:30:56 PM):  yeah, same here
michael (8:30:59 PM):  Still here.
amy (8:31:40 PM):  and back
michael (8:31:40 PM):  Hmm, well the fundraising experience has got to be less applicable than the nanny or child care at least. Even if the exact job tasks aren't clear.
george (8:31:44 PM):  i think when someone enters or exits, all the names disappear momentarily
george (8:32:01 PM):  that last one might have been nick leaving
amy (8:32:07 PM):  who we looking at? resume?
michael (8:32:43 PM):  Hmm, yeah, no nick any more.
michael (8:33:03 PM):  I guess we should just start, not wait for nick and Sarah?
amy (8:33:32 PM):  sure
george (8:33:43 PM):  ok
michael (8:34:02 PM):  Fundraising was Mark, Nanny was Carla, I think, if you were talking about my comment.
amy (8:35:05 PM):  gotcha-  so that is not he most important to get this job....
amy (8:35:23 PM):  sorry about my typos-  not used to this laptop yet
amy (8:36:27 PM):  wanna go thru carlas resume first ?
george (8:36:43 PM):  sure
michael (8:36:44 PM):  Sure.
george (8:37:00 PM):  i wonder how old carla is
michael (8:37:24 PM):  Ha, yeah, when I hear nanny I think someone older.
george (8:37:30 PM):  she's got a perfect driving record and rides horses!  coincidence?
amy (8:37:35 PM):  '06 high school grad
george (8:37:44 PM):  i think she rides a horse and not a car!
amy (8:37:58 PM):  yeah  only less than a year as part-time nanny
george (8:38:00 PM):  ah good eye, amy
nick (8:38:12 PM):  Ah, hello
amy (8:38:12 PM):  thats what i'm here for!  :)
amy (8:38:23 PM):  hi there nick
nick (8:38:35 PM):  That took a little while to get in....
michael (8:38:36 PM):  My parents always told me not to ride the horses on the paved roads, it hurts their feet or something.
george (8:38:44 PM):  hello
michael (8:38:51 PM):  Annoying considering more and more roads are paved here, ha.
amy (8:38:59 PM):  well that is a considerate thought for the horses
michael (8:39:01 PM):  Hi nick.
nick (8:39:14 PM):  Hey michael
nick (8:39:27 PM):  What have I missed?
michael (8:39:38 PM):  We just started reviewing Carla's resume.
amy (8:40:20 PM):  her only other exp is less than a year also in high school
michael (8:40:24 PM):  george was wondering how old she was, amy noticed she graduated high school in '06.
michael (8:40:58 PM):  I do like how she mentioned tutoring in the nanny job description, though.
amy (8:41:15 PM):  wait a sec-  now i see that her college info says MA '08
michael (8:41:21 PM):  That's more in line with the "committed to making a positive difference" part of the job description in my mind then the applicant who just put something like child care services.
michael (8:41:35 PM):  than* even.
george (8:41:57 PM):  i think carla might have got her zip code wrong
amy (8:42:00 PM):  yes michael- she described what she did a little
nick (8:42:13 PM):  I like that she mentions "the child's needs and well-being"
amy (8:43:05 PM):  yeah nick-  it says a little about her exp with the child- rather than just saying nanny
michael (8:43:34 PM):  Heh, 01234....I remember talking to someone who processed surveys at IBM and he had a bunch of numbers people often entered as fake data. "123 Street", etc..
george (8:43:37 PM):  i don't know much about child development, but care for 6 year olds may only partially overlap with our 7-14 age group
michael (8:44:00 PM):  Yeah, I guess our group is older.
nick (8:44:07 PM):  Are we going through the resumes in order?
michael (8:44:27 PM):  Sounds good.
amy (8:44:31 PM):  yeah its not completely related especially bc she only worked with one child and not a  group which the Y might require-  Might being the key word
george (8:44:35 PM):  going in order sounds good to me
meg (8:44:38 PM):  Hi all
meg (8:44:42 PM):  Sorry i am so late!
amy (8:44:53 PM):  k  who is next
amy (8:44:58 PM):  Hi meg
michael (8:44:58 PM):  Hi meg.
meg (8:45:09 PM):  Hi
george (8:45:12 PM):  hi meg
meg (8:45:15 PM):  My cat was missing, sorry!
meg (8:45:21 PM):  We found him
george (8:45:38 PM):  richard anderson
meg (8:45:40 PM):  How are we doing this?
amy (8:45:42 PM):  oh good!  poor kitty
meg (8:46:01 PM):  He was hiding under the neighbor's stairs
meg (8:46:03 PM):  :(
george (8:46:11 PM):  ohh richard says our company is reputed...one point for him!
michael (8:46:32 PM):  meg: we just finished going through Carla's resume and are moving on to Richard.
george (8:46:34 PM):  is he an indoor cat?
meg (8:46:46 PM):  Ok, and yes
nick (8:46:49 PM):  "reputed"? I think he means "reputable"
meg (8:46:51 PM):  He's a big baby and can
meg (8:46:58 PM):  not handle outdoors
amy (8:47:05 PM):  his best part is that he tutored in grades 3-5 but doesnt say for how long...and he is in a Psych program in college
george (8:47:12 PM):  oh, good catch...let's take that point away!
amy (8:47:35 PM):  haha  minus points so far!
meg (8:47:49 PM):  He graduated 10th in his class though
meg (8:47:50 PM):  +1?
michael (8:47:51 PM):  Hmm, "flexible schedule", that's a plus. No complaints when asked to work the odd weegeorged shift.
meg (8:47:55 PM):  out of 170
nick (8:47:57 PM):  I don't see much qualification for the position on his resume...
george (8:48:08 PM):  grades 3-5 is typically 9-11 year olds i think
amy (8:48:09 PM):  i like him better than carla already
meg (8:48:18 PM):  But he did tutor
amy (8:48:48 PM):  7-14 is what they are looking for so thats not so bad
michael (8:48:53 PM):  Manning a telephone gets some communication points. Multi-tasking too, since you get them randomly.
george (8:49:12 PM):  strangely enough carla's unclear background fits our unclear ad :P
meg (8:49:15 PM):  So wait, is he -2 right now?
amy (8:49:23 PM):  flexibility part is good too michael
michael (8:49:30 PM):  Charity quiz might be worth some points towards "committed to making a positive difference", I guess.
meg (8:50:17 PM):  He doesn't list his GPA though
meg (8:50:27 PM):  Which makes me think that he might be partying too much as a freshman
nick (8:50:35 PM):  By the way - do we have a job title for the open position???
amy (8:50:37 PM):  looks like hes a freshman
george (8:50:45 PM):  high school was 3.8 tho
amy (8:50:47 PM):  nope-  big problem nick
george (8:50:55 PM):  nick asks a good question
michael (8:50:58 PM):  Yeah, all of them seem to be in progress on degrees. I guess one had a BA.
meg (8:51:04 PM):  Probably care-taker
meg (8:51:18 PM):  my room mate works for the Y as an afterschool councelor?
meg (8:51:24 PM):  So probably something like that
nick (8:51:30 PM):  The posting asks for experience but doesn't specify in what exactly
meg (8:51:47 PM):  Experience in child care probably
nick (8:52:07 PM):  OK afterschool counselor sounds good
amy (8:52:19 PM):  yeah that makes it difficult to hire the right person without knowing what we're hiring for-   but we figure someone who can work with kids overall
michael (8:52:38 PM):  meg: what exactly does that entail? Do they manage a group or kids? Or are they just available for kids with problems?
michael (8:52:57 PM):  group of kids*, typo, sorry.
meg (8:53:21 PM):  She works with a group of kids, managing about 80 altogether with a staff of about 10 people, they have to do gym time, spend time outdoors or do homework
meg (8:53:35 PM):  I got it:)
meg (8:53:55 PM):  And they have rules about no running, etc...
george (8:54:01 PM):  would anybody like to move on?  i think we probably mentioned everything on richard's app
meg (8:54:02 PM):  (In the halls)
amy (8:54:23 PM):  sure george
george (8:54:27 PM):  hi mara
mara (8:54:35 PM):  hey everyone!
michael (8:54:37 PM):  Ah, that helps, thanks. I was thinking like my high school guidance counselor, ha.
meg (8:54:39 PM):  moderator just messaged me on gmail and said its "child counselor"
meg (8:54:42 PM):  The position
meg (8:54:46 PM):  Hi mara
mara (8:54:46 PM):  think ill be able to grasp whats going on?
michael (8:55:00 PM):  Hi mara.
meg (8:55:03 PM):  I was late too- its not hard to catch u[
nick (8:55:03 PM):  So tutoring doesn't really cover what the counselor would be doing
meg (8:55:06 PM):  *p
meg (8:55:12 PM):  Exactly
amy (8:55:17 PM):  hi mara!
george (8:55:23 PM):  *=*=Mark Stewart=*=*
mara (8:55:31 PM):  HI AGAIN! haha
michael (8:55:31 PM):  maraL we've been reviewing resumes in order. Carla and Richard so far.
meg (8:55:34 PM):  We're going though the resume's and choosing the right person for the job- we did the first 2 already
meg (8:55:46 PM):  (Or well, I missed the first one lol)
michael (8:55:47 PM):  mara:* even.
mara (8:55:47 PM):  ok gotcha
amy (8:56:09 PM):  no child exp-  was part of college orientation
george (8:56:10 PM):  teaching kids how to fight back against the school bully
meg (8:56:50 PM):  He has no experience
george (8:57:03 PM):  yup, we're on mark stewart now
amy (8:57:03 PM):  worst resume yet
meg (8:57:15 PM):  I agree
mara (8:57:25 PM):  ok mark...
michael (8:57:28 PM):  Fund raising gives some points for communication and outgoing at least.
michael (8:57:40 PM):  I'd much rather experience with the age group, though, yeah.
george (8:57:48 PM):  he might be able to help with biology homework!
nick (8:57:52 PM):  I like that he mentions "Volunteerism and Leadership"
mara (8:57:54 PM):  agree with amy.. after reviewing them earlier I thought he was outta place for sure
amy (8:57:55 PM):  he has some leadership skills though and yes, communication
meg (8:58:26 PM):  Yeah but if they're looking for someone who is experienced then I'd cross him off
amy (8:58:27 PM):  i dont know that they do homework in this position though-
mara (8:58:34 PM):  photoshop! woohooo
nick (8:58:49 PM):  yes, he lacks experience
amy (8:59:00 PM):  ok-  we have an impressioon of him so lets move on...we will go back after we hit all of them   ??
meg (8:59:09 PM):  Sounds good
george (8:59:14 PM):  haha mara, i was going to mention how i like how he puts photoshop at the end
mara (8:59:18 PM):  but outside of that... he has no experience with the occupational environment at all
george (8:59:33 PM):  like he was thinking "...oh yeah, can't forget photoshop"
meg (8:59:40 PM):  Hahaha
nick (8:59:50 PM):  Emily wins!!!!!! :)
amy (8:59:51 PM):  hehe
meg (8:59:56 PM):  I like hers so far
meg (9:00:04 PM):  She has experience
mara (9:00:06 PM):  hahah its a realatively easy program to work with thats why i laugh
meg (9:00:13 PM):  But she's VERY vague
amy (9:00:22 PM):  why dont these people state how long  they've done a job???
michael (9:00:33 PM):  Volunteering and child care experience, better.
mara (9:00:52 PM):  yes.. she has writing skills, verbal skills, leadership... seems much more professional style as well
amy (9:01:13 PM):  i like how she has some volunteer experience-  although nothing child related necessarily
nick (9:01:25 PM):  it's funny, but her listing the "objective" makes me feel she is more interested in the position - and I have never liked listing an objective on my own resume!
mara (9:01:36 PM):  i didnt know that UAlbany had a communications degree..?
meg (9:01:43 PM):  I think that she's the best
meg (9:01:48 PM):  It does
george (9:01:50 PM):  i wonder what emily has been up to between 2003 and 2011
michael (9:01:54 PM):  That's a good point. Seeing all those expected degrees the candidates have makes me think they are going to leave once they graduate.
meg (9:01:55 PM):  My old roomie was there
amy (9:02:01 PM):  they are made up resumes
george (9:02:01 PM):  er...now rather than 2011 :P
amy (9:02:06 PM):  george  hahaha
mara (9:02:36 PM):  communication, as in interpersonal... not communications as in technology
mara (9:02:43 PM):  theres a difference meg
nick (9:02:45 PM):  taht's a good point - maybe she's beena full-time student?
mara (9:02:51 PM):  but regardless... i like her
meg (9:02:57 PM):  True
meg (9:03:01 PM):  True
amy (9:03:20 PM):  she is better than some others
meg (9:03:47 PM):  Ok, I looked ahead and Robert Jordan is already off the list.
michael (9:03:48 PM):  A communications degree might teach you to be sensitive around the various ethnic and religious issues that come up with a large group of people at least.
meg (9:03:53 PM):  He spelled utilize wrong.
meg (9:04:01 PM):  LOL\
george (9:04:26 PM):  robert jordan wrote wheel of time tho :(
amy (9:04:27 PM):  nothing relevant to the job-  he doesnt earn any pts with me
meg (9:04:35 PM):  I know... good writer
nick (9:04:37 PM):  yep, i'm a spelling Nazi
meg (9:04:51 PM):  But fictional getting a job RJ not so good
amy (9:04:53 PM):  untlize   Lol
nick (9:05:03 PM):  not counting chat, of course....
mara (9:05:15 PM):  ummmm im working on my masters in communication at UAlbany right now... im just comfused about the "s" added there its not a big deal but seems as though she confused the two
michael (9:05:20 PM):  Hmm, is he the only one with a complete degree so far?
mara (9:05:43 PM):  i think Emily as well
mara (9:05:52 PM):  but he is in the honor society, which says something for sure
mara (9:05:58 PM):  he is a fast learner i bet
amy (9:06:02 PM):  he def just needs a job...not looking for the experience
michael (9:06:04 PM):  Discussions, lectures, grading papers, drama club...he seems to have communication related plusses.
meg (9:06:04 PM):  Emily is 2011
george (9:06:08 PM):  would you prefer someone with a complete degree?
meg (9:06:38 PM):  Not to work with kids, if their degree is completely unrelated
amy (9:06:41 PM):  the job descrip does say "exp preferred"
meg (9:06:43 PM):  English? Nahh
mara (9:07:02 PM):  ehhh... age matters you dont want someone too old then children will lose inerest with the,
amy (9:07:06 PM):  so exp or a relevant degree should be ok
meg (9:07:30 PM):  I think that Emily Brown is our girl
michael (9:07:33 PM):  Good point. I guess the only relevant degree I see is the Psychology one.
mara (9:07:41 PM):  seeems like a book worm..
meg (9:07:46 PM):  She has communication skills
michelle (9:07:53 PM):  complete degree might not be very important here
mara (9:08:23 PM):  what was your assessment of richard? scalre from 1-10 overall?
meg (9:08:42 PM):  Umm, he wasn't as good
michael (9:08:52 PM):  Yeah, even Robert is working on another one, so I can't use his complete as an argument for him not leaving once he finished a degree.
amy (9:08:57 PM):  emily or richard are on my list
mara (9:08:59 PM):  ok... what about Carla? I like her!
michelle (9:09:05 PM):  his schedule is flexible
meg (9:09:13 PM):  I kind of do too
george (9:09:18 PM):  richard has actually worked with children in our age group tho
meg (9:09:19 PM):  but she wants to work with teenagers
nick (9:09:21 PM):  I would nominate Emily and Carla as finalists
meg (9:09:30 PM):  and its for younger kids
george (9:09:32 PM):  9 to 11 yr olds
nick (9:09:35 PM):  Carla is CPR/First Aid Certified, which could be very valuable
mara (9:09:44 PM):  saame as nick
michelle (9:09:53 PM):  I agree with nick
meg (9:10:26 PM):  I dunno, I'm torn between Richard, Carla and Emily
michael (9:10:42 PM):  Richard is the one with the Psychology degree as well
michael (9:10:49 PM):  In progress anyway.
amy (9:11:09 PM):  maybe we should weight the pros of each-  like a point system
amy (9:11:21 PM):  then we can get an answer
michelle (9:11:32 PM):  Richard is good too.
mara (9:11:42 PM):  I like that Carla was a tutor for the child she watched
meg (9:11:50 PM):  Yeah
george (9:11:54 PM):  nobody seems to disagree that mark and robert are bottom 2
meg (9:11:56 PM):  She had more intensive care
mara (9:12:03 PM):  that says something baout her ability to work with children on a serious level
amy (9:12:08 PM):  yes  george
meg (9:12:13 PM):  Mark and Robert are the weakest links.
mara (9:12:16 PM):  yup george
meg (9:12:17 PM):  Goodbye!
nick (9:12:19 PM):  Yes, george
michelle (9:12:22 PM):  yeah, george
nick (9:12:40 PM):  The tribe has spogeorge
meg (9:12:49 PM):  Hahaha
amy (9:12:50 PM):  lets list richards good points to get it all straightened out...
george (9:12:53 PM):  k
meg (9:12:57 PM):  Good plan
amy (9:13:17 PM):  psych degree in progress...
meg (9:13:17 PM):  Psych degree=+1
george (9:13:20 PM):  btw...richard put his tutoring under interests
michael (9:13:21 PM):  Tutoring in the age group we're interested in.
michael (9:13:33 PM):  flexible schedule.
mara (9:13:40 PM):  1) flexible schedule!
meg (9:13:45 PM):  Self starter with volunteer experience
amy (9:13:45 PM):  communication skills- answered calls from public
meg (9:13:47 PM):  +1
michael (9:13:54 PM):  new filing system -> self starter?
meg (9:14:01 PM):  So he's at like 4
meg (9:14:19 PM):  No organizing charity quiz that raised money
mara (9:14:34 PM):  yeah but anyone can say they have good comm. skills... you need an interview to assess the truth of that
nick (9:14:35 PM):  "reputed company" still bothers me - that's bad English
amy (9:14:35 PM):  maybe interests means he wasnt paid?
michael (9:14:44 PM):  Handling calls should count as multi-tasking points too, they interrupt, you get multiple sometimes, etc..
mara (9:15:04 PM):  i think flexibility and tutoring are the only things he has as a one up on the others
amy (9:15:11 PM):  yeah the spelling is not the best thing fora resume...but our choices are not so good as it is  nick
amy (9:15:29 PM):  i like the psych degree
nick (9:15:40 PM):  I would vote against him, since we have two others we like
michelle (9:15:51 PM):  psych degree could be a plus
george (9:15:51 PM):  actually reputed is a real word apparently :o
george (9:16:07 PM):  Main Entry: reputed Function: adjective Date: 1549 1 : having a good repute : reputable 2 : being such according to reputation or general belief <a reputed mobster>
michelle (9:16:09 PM):  how many points the others got?
michael (9:16:18 PM):  So Carla and Emily are the other two options...
amy (9:16:25 PM):  i think we covered him  pretty well.... lets move onto emily
meg (9:16:30 PM):  I think he had 4 total
meg (9:16:37 PM):  Hahaha I'm counting
michelle (9:16:43 PM):  So Emily...
amy (9:16:47 PM):  awesome meg@
amy (9:16:49 PM):  !
nick (9:17:28 PM):  She volunteered the the Red Cross
nick (9:17:35 PM):  *for
mara (9:17:39 PM):  Child care, red cross, and working on communication degree
amy (9:17:40 PM):  she has child care listed which is good (but doesnt say for how long)
george (9:17:42 PM):  child care experience
amy (9:17:56 PM):  relief work at ARC seems pretty good
amy (9:18:04 PM):  3 pts?
mara (9:18:12 PM):  i think Richard is better than Emily, but Carla beats them both out
meg (9:18:17 PM):  Communication degree
meg (9:18:28 PM):  Woops
george (9:18:30 PM):  3 sounds about right :P
meg (9:18:32 PM):  I'm redundant
meg (9:18:33 PM):  lol
amy (9:18:34 PM):  yeah  richard is better than emily
meg (9:18:47 PM):  Ok Emily is out
amy (9:18:51 PM):  repute
mara (9:19:02 PM):  ok so carla?
amy (9:19:08 PM):  so Carla....the moment of truth....
michael (9:19:09 PM):  Hmm, Carla has some good communication points I didn't notice the first time around: facilitated meetings, liaison, acting as a rep..
meg (9:19:19 PM):  CPR certified
michael (9:19:23 PM):  Nanny experience is the bigger plus, though.
george (9:19:24 PM):  carla vs richard showdown!
michael (9:19:34 PM):  Even if it is a year outside our range.
mara (9:19:36 PM):  hahah i really like how she adds her interests in the end of the resume... she is trying to be personable with us ya know?
meg (9:19:37 PM):  Concentration in psych in hs
amy (9:20:00 PM):  but in high sschool?
meg (9:20:14 PM):  She's still learning about it?
michelle (9:20:17 PM):  between psych degree and CPR/First aid certified, which one is more important here?
meg (9:20:19 PM):  Kind of
meg (9:20:27 PM):  CPR
mara (9:20:29 PM):  nanny, student council pres (says she is organized and responsible), psych concentration and CPR
mara (9:20:36 PM):  ahh.. 5 things!
mara (9:20:37 PM):  haha
meg (9:20:40 PM):  But richard could always get certification after he's hired
michael (9:20:47 PM):  Organized events might count for self-starter, politics for the sort of person who would be "committed to making a positive difference".
amy (9:21:05 PM):  i would def interview carla and richard to find out how much exp with kids they have
michelle (9:21:07 PM):  thanks, meg
nick (9:21:12 PM):  CPR/first aid is more important
meg (9:21:24 PM):  Yeah
meg (9:21:27 PM):  Hahaha
mara (9:21:28 PM):  yeah amy.. i agreee an interview is needed
amy (9:21:35 PM):  5 pts for carla?
george (9:21:37 PM):  uh oh, richard down for the count!
meg (9:21:38 PM):  I third that
meg (9:21:44 PM):  Carla wins
michael (9:21:47 PM):  The Albany Y has a pool. Maybe they'd kick the swimmers out and have the life guard do the CPR, heh.
michelle (9:22:01 PM):  fourth
meg (9:22:03 PM):  That could work
mara (9:22:24 PM):  anyone against carla..?
amy (9:22:37 PM):  i'm good with  that
nick (9:22:46 PM):  <crickets>
meg (9:22:48 PM):  Nope
mara (9:22:48 PM):  speak now or forever hold your peace
mara (9:23:09 PM):  ok then.. CARLA it is!
george (9:23:11 PM):  yea, carla seems like a good choice
amy (9:23:13 PM):  i'm speaking but you cant hear me
mara (9:23:16 PM):  im sooo happy for her haha
meg (9:23:17 PM):  Carla wins:)
amy (9:23:28 PM):  yay for carla
meg (9:23:29 PM):  The only problem I forsee:
meg (9:23:44 PM):  Is that she wants to work with teens she might quit after a short time period
mara (9:23:45 PM):  ahhh...
meg (9:23:47 PM):  ?
meg (9:23:56 PM):  BAD NEWS BEARS
mara (9:24:10 PM):  well then we can always call richard! haha
nick (9:24:11 PM):  Debbie Downer
amy (9:24:15 PM):  any kind of child care service is high turnover....
meg (9:24:22 PM):  Hahahaha
meg (9:24:24 PM):  Sorry guys
mara (9:24:28 PM):  cuz kids can be mean!
amy (9:24:34 PM):  at least you have someone there for a  timebeing who enjoys it and can offer somethign to the kids
meg (9:24:34 PM):  :-P
george (9:24:39 PM):  you were rooting for carla, mara?
meg (9:24:40 PM):  I think Carla is the right choice
amy (9:25:17 PM):  she might change her mind and like the younger kids and not go for a teens job!
michelle (9:25:21 PM):  I am reconsidering Carla because of the teenage counselor thing.
amy (9:25:25 PM):  :)
meg (9:25:32 PM):  h
meg (9:25:34 PM):  ahahaha
meg (9:25:40 PM):  I'm turning people to the dark side
mara (9:25:40 PM):  yeah i was before i gothere haha
george (9:25:43 PM):  uh oh...does richard re-enter the fray?
mara (9:25:45 PM):  i thought about it all the way home actually
amy (9:26:00 PM):  nooooo
mara (9:26:01 PM):  i was really excited to come in late and see how you guys had already assessed her
amy (9:26:01 PM):  lol
michelle (9:26:06 PM):  Hehe
george (9:26:09 PM):  richard, bloodied and hobbling but not done!
michael (9:26:11 PM):  It is kind of funny to put "teenage" on the resume for a job that references younger kids too.
nick (9:26:19 PM):  Haven't we reached a decision?
meg (9:26:26 PM):  Hahaha I can't tell if youi're being sarcastic or not
mara (9:26:30 PM):  so what now?
george (9:26:35 PM):  to richard's credit, he has more experience right in the middle of our age group of 7-14
meg (9:26:40 PM):  Not yet!
meg (9:26:44 PM):  :)
meg (9:27:04 PM):  We toss a coin
mara (9:27:11 PM):  george...what are you saying? are you going against my girl?
amy (9:27:16 PM):  theres a website for coinflipping!
george (9:27:24 PM):  i think carla's losing support from the amys and the george!
meg (9:27:28 PM):  Yesss!
meg (9:27:34 PM):  And the meg
amy (9:27:40 PM):  hahaha  i think either one would be ok
meg (9:28:00 PM):  Heads=Carla, Tails=Richard
amy (9:28:00 PM):  i think carla is fine bc she might like working with younger kids better after the exp at the Y
nick (9:28:08 PM):  I thought we already had a unanimous vote???
amy (9:28:20 PM):  i'm for Carla
mara (9:28:23 PM):  no one is persuading me!!
george (9:28:29 PM):  does it matter they live in MA?
meg (9:28:32 PM):  I'm for richard...
amy (9:28:41 PM):  george  Ssshhhhh
michelle (9:28:45 PM):  Richard!
mara (9:28:50 PM):  meg... its ok if you sign off now! haha
amy (9:28:52 PM):  oh no!  meg!
michael (9:28:57 PM):  If it is a big program, meg mentioned 80 in her example, there might be room for her to work with just the older kids.
meg (9:29:03 PM):  :(
meg (9:29:07 PM):  Oh nooo
meg (9:29:18 PM):  Oh that actually makes sense
meg (9:29:28 PM):  Then I might be willing to concede the point
meg (9:29:34 PM):  *ceed?
meg (9:29:38 PM):  Idk
george (9:29:38 PM):  hmm...i would never!
amy (9:29:40 PM):  everyone, state your verdict!
michael (9:29:45 PM):  I did notice there was one Albany contact address in there...Emily.
mara (9:29:57 PM):  CARLA... women are always better with kids
michael (9:29:57 PM):  She might be more familar with the school systems or something, I guess.
meg (9:30:17 PM):  That's not true!
amy (9:30:21 PM):  but if they are all here for college...they might be libing here including summers
amy (9:30:23 PM):  living
meg (9:30:25 PM):  Men can be good with kids too
george (9:30:42 PM):  amy is flip flopping!
michelle (9:30:49 PM):  I think we need to have a photo of each applicant :-)
amy (9:30:50 PM):  nope-  carla is my choice
nick (9:30:51 PM):  Carla is working for the family in Albany
mara (9:30:52 PM):  can be!... key words
meg (9:31:00 PM):  Hahaha now we look at them!
meg (9:31:22 PM):  Awww. Don't pick on the guys:-P
meg (9:31:30 PM):  He's got experience with youngsters
george (9:31:31 PM):  wait...i can't tell who's in the lead anymore
amy (9:31:38 PM):  link   LOL!
michael (9:31:40 PM):  I'll vote Carla, it would be nice to call her and Richard up at least, though.
meg (9:31:44 PM):  -Richard-
amy (9:32:05 PM):  by the way   men and women are equal with caring for children   depends on the person
nick (9:32:11 PM):  OK let's have htem both in for interviews
george (9:32:12 PM):  concede is correct i believe
nick (9:32:19 PM):  *them!
meg (9:32:22 PM):  Thanks george
meg (9:32:27 PM):  Thanks george
mara (9:32:41 PM):  haha.. i know amy i was just kidding around to strengthen my choice
amy (9:32:49 PM):  hehehe
meg (9:33:01 PM):  So is carla still winning?
george (9:33:04 PM):  that one florida teacher who had a kid with a 14 yr old student...:o
amy (9:33:13 PM):  i lost track
mara (9:33:16 PM):  carla already won as far as im concerned
george (9:33:27 PM):  lol michelle
amy (9:33:30 PM):  me too mara-  hehe
meg (9:33:48 PM):  I'm still for richard
meg (9:33:54 PM):  Unless he's really ugly
meg (9:33:55 PM):  Hahaha
michelle (9:33:58 PM):  Richard..
meg (9:34:00 PM):  And then he'd scare the kids
meg (9:34:02 PM):  :-P
mara (9:34:11 PM):  ok well i know him... and he is soooo ugly
meg (9:34:14 PM):  Since we need pics
meg (9:34:16 PM):  Hahaha
meg (9:34:22 PM):  You know fictional richard?
george (9:34:23 PM):  is this a hunter or gatherer position?
meg (9:34:23 PM):  Lol
amy (9:34:24 PM):  to be honest.....
mara (9:34:47 PM):  question: isnt this the phenomenon that they are studying?  The fact that someone can persuade you into something you dont want?
amy (9:34:48 PM):  companies never choose only one candidate anyway, so i think we are fine with choosing both richard and carla
meg (9:35:04 PM):  Probably
meg (9:35:23 PM):  I think its a hunter (therefore male) position
michelle (9:35:26 PM):  If we have budget, we can also interview Emily
george (9:35:28 PM):  you're welcome!
meg (9:35:31 PM):  Although my profs would kill me for that
meg (9:35:54 PM):  Men and women both hunted in hunter-gatherer societies
meg (9:36:10 PM):  But everyone thinks of 'man-the-hunter'
amy (9:36:11 PM):  hunted?  hunter?
george (9:36:20 PM):  i think richard has my vote now
amy (9:36:26 PM):  what are we talking about here
meg (9:36:29 PM):  s
meg (9:36:32 PM):  sweet
george (9:36:33 PM):  me and meg need to find out how ugly he is
meg (9:36:44 PM):  Thanks george
meg (9:36:46 PM):  :)
michelle (9:36:56 PM):  me too
meg (9:36:58 PM):  Ok so thats 3 for richard
mara (9:37:02 PM):  we have 7 mins.. so decide now
george (9:37:04 PM):  what if carla is ugly too tho
meg (9:37:16 PM):  then we should start over
michelle (9:37:19 PM):  then Emily
mara (9:37:20 PM):  CARLA
amy (9:37:39 PM):  let me make one more point if i can....
meg (9:37:46 PM):  Ok
amy (9:38:04 PM):  where in richards resume do you see him working WITH people?
george (9:38:25 PM):  how about we interview carla first to see if she's hot
michael (9:38:34 PM):  tutoring...
mara (9:38:39 PM):  organizing a charity event... im sure he had to have some communication with people
mara (9:38:42 PM):  and tutoring
michelle (9:38:45 PM):  handling calls
michael (9:38:47 PM):  telephones
meg (9:38:50 PM):  and telephone calls
george (9:39:13 PM):  that's because we men have the muscle to lug the carcass back to camp!
amy (9:39:18 PM):  carla -->  child care, facilitated meetings, worked with other officers, liiason
george (9:39:31 PM):  you're welcome!
amy (9:39:33 PM):  but phone calls are not with people face to face
meg (9:39:36 PM):  Hahahaha george- is that because you moved last week
mara (9:39:53 PM):  4 mins..
meg (9:39:56 PM):  But tutoring little kids is and that is who he'd be working with
amy (9:40:00 PM):  he tutored but that seems the only face to face interaction other than being in an office handling calls
meg (9:40:20 PM):  and organizing charity quiz
meg (9:40:33 PM):  thats gotta have interaction
george (9:40:44 PM):  does anybody else think carla and emily should have an oil wrestling match for the position?
amy (9:40:51 PM):  true
mara (9:41:05 PM):  oil wrestling? whats that going to prove?
amy (9:41:05 PM):  not really george  :P
mara (9:41:13 PM):  haha they are not St.Pierre after all
meg (9:41:13 PM):  I still vote for richard but the wrestling mtch is a good idea
michelle (9:41:20 PM):  we need reference from the applicants too
mara (9:41:23 PM):  CARLA!
george (9:41:30 PM):  yea he tutored
meg (9:41:34 PM):  RICHARD
amy (9:41:36 PM):  Carla!!
amy (9:41:47 PM):  but carla had child care exp
mara (9:41:49 PM):  eww 2 for carla
amy (9:41:57 PM):  lol
michelle (9:42:01 PM):  richard
michael (9:42:05 PM):  I'm still for Carla.

ariel (20:06:41 PM):  i would want to go to spain
ted (20:07:03 PM):  lets talk about cities
ted (20:07:09 PM):  not countries
tia (20:07:14 PM):  Okay
tia (20:07:30 PM):  I want to return to Athens, Greece, but Paris is also of interest
ariel (20:07:31 PM):  So I want to go to Madrid
cinthia (20:07:47 PM):  Rome, Venice, Paris, Capri
cinthia (20:07:51 PM):  Athens
cinthia (20:07:54 PM):  i cant decide
leah (20:07:59 PM):  rome
ariel (20:08:00 PM):  man there are so many places to pick from
ted (20:08:06 PM):  paris is in my list of places to visit
leah (20:08:12 PM):  way too many
ariel (20:08:42 PM):  i guess paris
ariel (20:08:51 PM):  i dun know i dont like french very much
ariel (20:08:58 PM):  not the people just the langauge
tia (20:09:21 PM):  Does anyone have a connection to any place through family or ancestry in Europe?
ted (20:09:24 PM):  anyone would like to visit amsterdam?
ariel (20:09:30 PM):  where is that?
tia (20:09:30 PM):  Amsterdam is of interest
leah (20:09:33 PM):  yes amsterdam
tia (20:09:47 PM):  Thanks for bringing Amsterdam up. It's in Holland.
ariel (20:09:55 PM):  oh yeah i want to go for sure!
ariel (20:10:05 PM):  lol i have a friend who lives there
tia (20:10:08 PM):  That's the city where everything goes; more than Paris
cinthia (20:10:10 PM):  i have family in england
ariel (20:10:24 PM):  oh Amsterdam's got my vote
tia (20:10:33 PM):  cinthia, is England of any interest to you for this trip?
cinthia (20:10:51 PM):  ummm... i do really wanna go to london. but not for family lol :-p
tia (20:11:20 PM):  I'm curious whether we're all approaching this from the same angle, as just some place we'd like to see
ariel (20:11:21 PM):  So can people list why they want to go?
ariel (20:11:26 PM):  when they say where
tia (20:11:31 PM):  or if there are biases based on family
ted (20:12:00 PM):  one city i would like to visit is Kiev,, the capital of Ukraine.
leah (20:12:03 PM):  rome id like to go because of the architecture, along w/ greece
tia (20:12:05 PM):  I have no family in Europe (unless Lithuania is considered part of Europe)
ted (20:12:06 PM):  it has a lot of history
ariel (20:12:10 PM):  Well I have a bias because I played world of warcraft with like a zillon dutch people
ariel (20:12:17 PM):  and so i want to go lol
tia (20:12:33 PM):  So, none of us is choosing any place because of family or ancestry?
leah (20:12:37 PM):  lol @ariel
ted (20:12:47 PM):  maybe dublin
ariel (20:12:48 PM):  Well isent Russia and Germany europe? so i think lithuania is too
ted (20:13:15 PM):  the best place to in, during st patricks day
ted (20:13:40 PM):  there are just too many cities to visit !!!
leah (20:13:54 PM):  wayy too many
cinthia (20:13:54 PM):  russia isnt europe
cinthia (20:14:06 PM):  i honestly dont know how well decide this
ted (20:14:09 PM):  russia is in europe
tia (20:14:11 PM):  Well, then I would have to add in Vilnius, Lithuania as a consideration, but maybe we should define Europe as those countries belonging to the European Union. Lithuania and Russia are not members.
ted (20:14:24 PM):  lithuania is also in europe
ted (20:14:33 PM):  both countries are in europe
ariel (20:14:33 PM):  Are you sure russia is not europe? then why are they covering it in detail in my european history class?
ted (20:14:43 PM):  they are not part of european union though
tia (20:14:46 PM):  On continent of Europe
leah (20:14:53 PM):  yea russia is in both europe and northenr asia
cinthia (20:15:04 PM):  i think it is euraisa
cinthia (20:15:10 PM):  it divides both
ariel (20:15:12 PM):  so then we cant count england because thats not continental europe
ariel (20:15:24 PM):  england is an island
ted (20:15:41 PM):  for this discussion we will include england and russia
tia (20:15:48 PM):  Ireland and England are part of continent of Europe; broke away from mainland
tia (20:15:59 PM):  I should say broke apart
tia (20:16:26 PM):  I'm okay with including England and Russia
leah (20:16:59 PM):  me too
ted (20:17:03 PM):  i would like each of us to name a few cities you would like to visit, so that we can discuss about them
cinthia (20:17:13 PM):  how about we go one at a time too
cinthia (20:17:17 PM):  so its not a circus
ariel (20:17:40 PM):  lol
ariel (20:17:44 PM):  moo?
ted (20:17:46 PM):  madrid?
leah (20:18:09 PM):  rome
ted (20:18:12 PM):  any body would spend $$$ to go madrid?
cinthia (20:18:22 PM):  no
tia (20:18:22 PM):  Yes, but not as first choice
ariel (20:18:26 PM):  same here
cinthia (20:18:27 PM):  ditto
leah (20:18:29 PM):  same
ted (20:18:45 PM):  tia, what is your first choice
tia (20:19:00 PM):  Probably Athens again. But Amsterdam is intriguing.
tia (20:19:50 PM):  Athens is a wonderful city.
ted (20:19:56 PM):  and for you leah?
leah (20:20:03 PM):  rome
ted (20:20:21 PM):  why?
leah (20:20:35 PM):  the architecture i think its amazing
ted (20:21:21 PM):  how about you cinthia, what are your top three choices?
cinthia (20:21:24 PM):  it is leah
cinthia (20:21:31 PM):  rome, paris, athens
tia (20:22:17 PM):  cinthia, I think you have to pick one
cinthia (20:22:42 PM):  he asked for my top 3 choices
cinthia (20:22:51 PM):  if i had to pick one id pick athens
tia (20:23:38 PM):  Do you want to advocate for Athens or another city?
ted (20:23:47 PM):  2 out 5 like athens. i personally prefer rome, and then paris.
ted (20:24:19 PM):  only after i visit those 2 i would consider athens
ted (20:24:36 PM):  could you tell me why you would pick athens over rome?
ariel (20:24:53 PM):  im gonna go grab some munchies brb
tia (20:25:16 PM):  From what I hear, Rome is crowded and surprisingly, Italian food is outdone by Greek cuisine
tia (20:25:25 PM):  Also when I think of Rome, I think of Catholicism
tia (20:25:36 PM):  For me, Athens is the place
cinthia (20:25:47 PM):  ehhh it is like that.. but i have to disagree tia. the food was amazing in rome
tia (20:26:13 PM):  Greek people are very friendly, and most speak English as their second language
tia (20:26:42 PM):  The dollar goes farther in Greece than in many other countries, even though the conversion in Euro is the same. A better bargain.
tia (20:27:17 PM):  I have an interest in Paris, but from what I hear, they like the tourists to speak French
ted (20:27:24 PM):  they are both old cities, with a lot of history
leah (20:27:26 PM):  i dont think the fact that someone might not speak their native language should be a deterrent though
tia (20:27:40 PM):  It goes to how welcomed you feel
ted (20:27:46 PM):  well parisians tend to be very nationalistic
tia (20:28:22 PM):  Paris, Athens, and Rome all have wonderful museums
ted (20:28:23 PM):  and are not always best hosts
tia (20:28:35 PM):  I don't know about Amsterdam
ted (20:28:38 PM):  but still i would go to Paris
cinthia (20:28:47 PM):  agreed
ariel (20:28:48 PM):  back
tia (20:28:55 PM):  What intrigues me about Amsterdam is the non-paternalism of the government toward its people
tia (20:29:14 PM):  In case you don't know, drugs are legal as is prostitution
ariel (20:29:34 PM):  cool
leah (20:29:43 PM):  yea i knew that
tia (20:29:47 PM):  They also allow euthanasia
ted (20:29:47 PM):  that is what makes it a popular destination
ariel (20:29:51 PM):  ok Amsterdam is for me!
leah (20:29:53 PM):  mhm
leah (20:29:55 PM):  haha
ariel (20:29:58 PM):  book my flight
ariel (20:30:11 PM):  i can even die there too
ted (20:30:12 PM):  but all those activities are somewhat regulated
leah (20:30:21 PM):  yeap
ariel (20:30:29 PM):  eh so what? I've got tons of cute gamer friends
ted (20:30:40 PM):  or at least taxed,lol
leah (20:30:43 PM):  haha
ariel (20:30:47 PM):  I can just hook-up, party, and play wow
ariel (20:30:54 PM):  sounds like a vacation to me
tia (20:31:02 PM):  ted, what did you want to say about regulations?
ariel (20:31:18 PM):  plus they are LOADED in amsterdam
ariel (20:31:33 PM):  seriously one of my friends on wow has like a maid and like two houses
cinthia (20:31:47 PM):  what is wow
cinthia (20:31:50 PM):  sorry i missed that part
ted (20:31:51 PM):  well, doing drugs, and prostitution are controlled
ariel (20:31:52 PM):  world of warcraft
ariel (20:31:59 PM):  lol
cinthia (20:32:01 PM):  gotcha
leah (20:32:04 PM):  lol
cinthia (20:32:19 PM):  so what are our top cities so far
ted (20:32:25 PM):  prostitures have weekly medical visits
ariel (20:32:29 PM):  its cool im geeky
leah (20:32:35 PM):  lol
ariel (20:32:36 PM):  and im happy with it
ted (20:32:38 PM):  and there is just so much drugs a person can intake
tia (20:32:46 PM):  Regulated to protect the people who use drugs and are prostitutes, as well as to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, is what I am aware of
ariel (20:32:54 PM):  eh well at least when you buy your whore you know shes clean
ariel (20:33:05 PM):  or he
tia (20:33:12 PM):  Then, of course, Holland has windmills and wooden shoes
leah (20:33:19 PM):  lol
ariel (20:33:24 PM):  dude holland has dutch ppl
ariel (20:33:28 PM):  dutch ppl are awesome
ariel (20:33:34 PM):  and they all speak english
ariel (20:33:38 PM):  in this cute accent
tia (20:33:43 PM):  Big place for tulips
ariel (20:33:51 PM):  zomg if you thought like and english accent was cool
ariel (20:33:56 PM):  you gotta hear these dutch ppl
leah (20:33:58 PM):  my portuguese professor is dutch
ted (20:34:06 PM):  lol
ariel (20:34:08 PM):  ??? that didnt make much sense
leah (20:34:18 PM):  yea it does.. hes dutch
cinthia (20:34:25 PM):  she was just stating that hes dutch
ted (20:34:25 PM):  yes it makes sense
ariel (20:34:40 PM):  -.^;
ted (20:34:55 PM):  So thus far,, Athens and Amsterdam, are in our selection list
ariel (20:35:10 PM):  yep
tia (20:35:11 PM):  ted, shouldn't you tell us about Madrid?
ariel (20:35:15 PM):  anyone got any others to add
ted (20:35:19 PM):  what about places in Germany or Portugal
ted (20:35:35 PM):  I have never been there.
tia (20:35:47 PM):  Why did you say Madrid as your first choice?
ted (20:35:48 PM):  i meant in madrid
ted (20:36:14 PM):  i was just asking, if anyone liked Madrid
tia (20:36:18 PM):  oh
cinthia (20:36:28 PM):  didnt someone say they would go to spain tho
tia (20:36:28 PM):  Can someone advocate for Paris?
ariel (20:36:40 PM):  I did but then I thought about it
ariel (20:36:47 PM):  and I remembered my WOW buddies
tia (20:36:51 PM):  oh
ariel (20:36:58 PM):  and that I hate the Vosotros form they use in spain
cinthia (20:37:07 PM):  so that is kind of a bias
cinthia (20:37:11 PM):  they are like your wow family
tia (20:37:15 PM):  What does that mean, ariel?
ted (20:37:20 PM):  ha ha for ariel's quote
tia (20:37:32 PM):  oh, you're talking grammar
ariel (20:37:35 PM):  yeah
ted (20:37:37 PM):  you take/took Spanish ariel?
ariel (20:37:45 PM):  yes its my minor
ariel (20:37:49 PM):  and im also bilingual
cinthia (20:37:56 PM):  awesome
ariel (20:37:57 PM):  well trilingual technically
tia (20:38:02 PM):  that's great
ariel (20:38:20 PM):  Japanese is the third its my major...
tia (20:38:32 PM):  kudos to you
ted (20:38:41 PM):  At first i was advocating for Kiev
ariel (20:38:42 PM):  lol thx its a big pain in the ass
ariel (20:38:49 PM):  but anyway back to spain spanish
ted (20:38:57 PM):  but i am not sure if anyone else would like that city
ariel (20:39:00 PM):  vosotros is used commonly in spain but not in most other countires
ariel (20:39:20 PM):  so if its your first exposure to spanish i would advise against it
ariel (20:39:31 PM):  although im sure others could make an arguement for the other side
tia (20:39:36 PM):  ted, I need you to tell about Kiev before I can find it of any interest
ted (20:39:37 PM):  of course
ariel (20:39:57 PM):  where is Kiev?
cinthia (20:40:10 PM):  ive heard of it
ted (20:40:18 PM):  it is in Ukraine
ariel (20:40:24 PM):  hmmm
ariel (20:40:27 PM):  not much interest to me
ariel (20:40:37 PM):  well actually... are the guys cute?
leah (20:40:37 PM):  lol
tia (20:40:40 PM):  Are they still fighting there?
ariel (20:40:58 PM):  I see we all have different agendas
ted (20:41:02 PM):  it is one of the oldest cities in europe
ted (20:41:11 PM):  but it is most of the time overlooked
ariel (20:41:30 PM):  yeah i think im gonna have to go with the masses and overlook it as well
tia (20:42:00 PM):  What is in Kiev?
ted (20:42:13 PM):  there is a lot of history
tia (20:42:30 PM):  Wasn't Ukraine part of the Soviet Union?
ted (20:42:32 PM):  because it used to belong to Poland, then lithuania, then russia
cinthia (20:42:43 PM):  wow thats crazy
tia (20:42:44 PM):  I did not know that
ted (20:42:54 PM):  so a lot happened there
tia (20:42:55 PM):  So, is this the first time it is independent?
leah (20:43:24 PM):  i didnt know that either
ted (20:43:37 PM):  i guess so
tia (20:43:48 PM):  Is it always cool/cold there, or are there four well-defined seasons?
ted (20:44:23 PM):  it probably like washinton DC

ted (20:46:11 PM):  but that is why i want to visit kiev. we know a lot about rome, paris, but not much about kiev, that is why for me it is kind of exotic
ted (20:46:22 PM):  both

cinthia (20:46:50 PM):  not really r they?
ted (20:46:57 PM):  there are museums, and historial buildings with items from every time period

ted (20:49:57 PM):  i am not sure about ukranian men, but i do know about swedish women. (or at least seen their beauty) lol
tia (20:50:04 PM):  Well, I don't think I've ever met someone from Ukraine

shelly (12:52:51 PM):  Hello michelle. How are you?
michelle (12:55:49 PM):  Hi shelly, nice to see you.
george (12:56:09 PM):  good afternoon
michelle (12:56:13 PM):  It took me a while to be able to login today. it is slow.
shelly (12:56:14 PM):  Hello george.
michelle (12:56:22 PM):  hi, george
george (12:56:53 PM):  hi :) are we allowed to use emoticons?
shelly (12:57:19 PM):  I don't think there's a chat police. Not that I know of anyway. ;)
shelly (12:58:15 PM):  No lag on my end michelle. Things seem to happening pretty quickly here.
george (12:58:55 PM):  a little lag here, but my virus scan just finished
shelly (12:59:30 PM):  Hey vincent.
vincent (12:59:46 PM):  Hi!  How's it going?
george (1:00:22 PM):  is this professor vincent or a different one?
vincent (1:00:55 PM):  different one.  maybe someday.
mara (1:01:36 PM):  so whats neone feel like talking about?
shelly (1:01:47 PM):  Okay, it's after 1pm and we seem to have a goodly number of people logged in. I guess we should get started (assuming we haven't started already) . . .
vincent (1:01:55 PM):  are we still waiting for people?
vincent (1:01:59 PM):  oh, i see
shelly (1:02:14 PM):  As you can see, my name's shelly. I'm supposed to be facilitating the group today . . .
mara (1:02:21 PM):  good idea... what about? any proposals?
shelly (1:02:36 PM):  Before we get to my ideas for a topic, I want to play with the medium a bit.
george (1:02:36 PM):  anyone seen watchmen?
george (1:02:41 PM):  :)
mara (1:02:53 PM):  yes i went to a screening before it cacme out
mara (1:03:01 PM):  FREE! might I add...
vincent (1:03:09 PM):  yes!  but let's let shelly do his/her thing first...
george (1:03:25 PM):  k
shelly (1:03:59 PM):  This is called a "chat" but it's still pretty artificial. We can't really rely on the usual conversational cues.
shelly (1:04:35 PM):  I haven't spent a lot of time in chat sessions, but one thing I've done in the past is to include elipses when I'm not finished with a thought. Like this . . .
shelly (1:04:52 PM):  That was important in prior chats when the screen for inputting characters was limited . .
mara (1:05:14 PM):  mmhmm
shelly (1:05:24 PM):  I'm not sure we labor under such restrictions here, but shorter sentences may speed up conversation . . .
michelle (1:05:38 PM):  I agree
mara (1:05:48 PM):  good idea
shelly (1:06:15 PM):  So, I guess first off we should introduce ourselves. Also, let's see if there's any value in ordering our comments . . .
vincent (1:06:33 PM):  ordering comments?
shelly (1:06:34 PM):  Let's give a sentence or so introducing ourselves in the order of the list to the right. I'm first . . .
shelly (1:07:21 PM):  I'm a graduate student at SUNY studing Information Science. I'm old and have a family and a part time job, as well as full time student work. michelle, you want to go next?
mara (1:07:41 PM):  nice to meet you!
michelle (1:08:29 PM):  I am an assistant professor in Department of information studies. I have a family, with two kids. old too. :-)
shelly (1:08:43 PM):  mara?
vincent (1:08:46 PM):  what's old??
shelly (1:09:06 PM):  Later than 30s?
michelle (1:09:12 PM):  hehe
vincent (1:09:18 PM):  fair.
mara (1:09:26 PM):  I'm also a graduate student.  I study interpersonal communication.  Not old haha and I'm babysitting right now!
shelly (1:09:59 PM):  george?
george (1:10:14 PM):  hi, i'm george; i'm an undergrad student studying computer science at SUNY Albany, i like bbqs and watching UFC, and trying new food
shelly (1:10:43 PM):  vincent?
mara (1:11:02 PM):  perfect weather for bbqs
george (1:11:30 PM):  yes, i would love to cook out today :)
vincent (1:11:31 PM):  I'm the only one who's currently not a student.  Graduated from fiction writing / journalism school, then moved out to the West Coast.  Currently "working" as a touring musician.
shelly (1:11:47 PM):  Cool.
shelly (1:12:10 PM):  Okay, the good part of ordering is keeping the conversation to a single flow . . .
shelly (1:12:23 PM):  The bad part is it's too dictatorial . . .
shelly (1:12:30 PM):  Let's try more free form now . . .
mara (1:12:30 PM):  what kind of music vincent?
michelle (1:12:47 PM):  coask
shelly (1:12:48 PM):  How much time has everyone spent in chat-type activities . . .
shelly (1:13:00 PM):  I've done a few but not much.
vincent (1:13:23 PM):  I'm mostly in a "rock band" but I play jazz and experimental music, too.  Whatever's there to be played!  Especially if I get to travel while playing it.
george (1:13:29 PM):  i used to hang out in IRC back when Quake II was big...spent many many hours chatting before
vincent (1:13:42 PM):  I chat pretty regularly, lots of long-distance friends
mara (1:14:01 PM):  cool!  I chat a lot, nothing new here
vincent (1:14:10 PM):  Do all of you guys live in the Albany area right now?
michelle (1:14:29 PM):  You mean online chat, or telephone chat...?
george (1:14:32 PM):  Albany
vincent (1:14:42 PM):  I think she meant online.
shelly (1:14:48 PM):  Online? Telephone is very different in my view.
shelly (1:14:55 PM):  I live in Albany.
shelly (1:15:12 PM):  Sorry, I mean online (no question).
mara (1:15:21 PM):  slingerlands, close to albany
michelle (1:15:28 PM):  My fully online blackboard course offers a chat similar to this one we are using now.
vincent (1:15:34 PM):  shelly- for some reason I'm assuming you're female, but the name could go either way.  Am I right?
mara (1:15:36 PM):  yeah online... sorry
george (1:15:48 PM):  lol
shelly (1:16:13 PM):  You are wrong. Must be my girly syntax, eh?
vincent (1:16:26 PM):  Sorry, got it now!
mara (1:16:29 PM):  michelle, I participate in blackboard seminar chat a lot for classes
mara (1:16:38 PM):  lol
michelle (1:16:49 PM):  mara, do you think it helps?
vincent (1:16:50 PM):  Your sentences were just so poetic.
shelly (1:17:08 PM):  Cool. I'm in michelle's class as well, but I haven't used the chat sessions before.
mara (1:17:15 PM):  yes very much so! esp. when you dont get everything said in class, ya know?
shelly (1:17:32 PM):  LOL. Yep, that's it. I wax poetic, like all women . . . ;)
mara (1:17:54 PM):  thanks, shelly!
vincent (1:18:02 PM):  Ha.
mara (1:18:24 PM):  so what were you going to say about watchmen shelly?
michelle (1:18:28 PM):  so today's first topic is chat-type activity, shelly? I just want to make sure I am on the right track
shelly (1:18:31 PM):  michelle, do you use chat for classes that aren't fully online?
shelly (1:19:02 PM):  Sure, why not. Seems like it's relevant and everyone should have an opinion.
michelle (1:19:26 PM):  shelly, yes. I also use chat for my other courses. I am trying to test the whiteBoard feature of the chat session. It seems a lot of fun there.
george (1:19:36 PM):  are you referring to the watchmen topic?
shelly (1:19:37 PM):  I haven't seen Watchman unfortunately. Read the comix way back when. I actually have the individual issues I'm so old.
vincent (1:19:40 PM):  In these classroom chats, are the professors involved as well?
michelle (1:20:06 PM):  me either.
vincent (1:20:44 PM):  whoa!  what is typing a blank comment mean?
michelle (1:20:46 PM):  vincent, I get myself involved in the chat sessions so I can answer questions lively
vincent (1:20:51 PM):  I mean "what does"
george (1:21:10 PM):  some of the characters don't come out like (less than sign) when it's at the beginning of the sentence
mara (1:21:11 PM):  we did a midterm test review on blackboard chat and the prof was very involved
george (1:21:22 PM):  (less than sign)
mara (1:21:40 PM):  (less than sign)
mara (1:21:49 PM):  ok yeah youre right lol
vincent (1:21:56 PM):  like, "not interested"?
shelly (1:22:09 PM):  Okay, since most folks have a bunch of experience with chats, are there textual conventions that you use to convey meaning, other than emoticons? Anything that seems particularly useful?
mara (1:22:25 PM):  lol
george (1:22:27 PM):  acronyms
mara (1:22:32 PM):  laugh out loud
vincent (1:22:48 PM):  yeah, abbreviations: brb, wtf
george (1:22:53 PM):  many of them contain swear words
mara (1:23:22 PM):  really? whats the meaning behind that... abbreviated swear words?
shelly (1:23:35 PM):  Sounds good. Most of the ones I know are part of the online gaming culture LFG, etc. Not really relevant here.
vincent (1:23:35 PM):  wtf = what the fuck
george (1:23:41 PM):  wtf, the f stands for a swear word
mara (1:23:54 PM):  i guess theres got to be some underlying reason why
george (1:24:02 PM):  yay!  i didn't say it
vincent (1:24:11 PM):  I think it's for younger kids who feel like they can't or shouldn't type swear words?
george (1:24:28 PM):  acronyms are just shorter
shelly (1:24:29 PM):  Very restrained george. vincent beat you to the punchline tho. lol
mara (1:24:40 PM):  wow interesting.. if im going to swear i will type it out! i feel like you get my point better
mara (1:24:46 PM):  lol
vincent (1:24:53 PM):  it's more effective, I think.
shelly (1:25:18 PM):  I don't text. Never seen much use in it. That activity uses huge amounts of abbreviations, no? Anyone facile with texting?
george (1:25:21 PM):  funny thing is lol got turned back into a word...which some people pronounce "lawl" in real life conversation
vincent (1:25:34 PM):  I'm pretty quick with it.
shelly (1:25:38 PM):  Or "lowl"
mara (1:25:43 PM):  i love it!
vincent (1:25:49 PM):  what's lowl?
mara (1:25:59 PM):  weird
shelly (1:26:04 PM):  LOL pronounced.
michelle (1:26:05 PM):  I love it, but seldom get a chance to use many
george (1:26:13 PM):  and that "lawl" is now typed lawl; a deliberate misspelling of lol which is an acronym
mara (1:26:23 PM):  i just say it... L-O-L ya know?
vincent (1:26:27 PM):  oh yeah.  I heard someone say ROFL out loud, "roffel"
vincent (1:26:46 PM):  and I just heard LMAO in a rap song?
shelly (1:26:52 PM):  So, if you use "lawl" instead of "lol" in chat, you are ubercool, eh?
george (1:26:57 PM):  yea, i've heard "roffel" too
mara (1:27:03 PM):  what song?
vincent (1:27:28 PM):  I don't remember, it was something with Lil' Wayne on it... something like, "on my way to the bank, LMAO"
shelly (1:27:46 PM):  There's a WOW-animated song on YouTube that pronounces ROFLMAO in the lyrics.
mara (1:27:53 PM):  oh yea... it sounds familiar
george (1:28:09 PM):  LMAO is a band isn't it?
vincent (1:28:28 PM):  there's a band called LFO - Low Flying Owls
mara (1:28:40 PM):  right heard of them
shelly (1:28:43 PM):  Okay, well I encourage folks to use whatever conventions they like while we chat, but beware that some of us non-chatters may get lost from time to time.
vincent (1:28:56 PM):  It's Lil' Wayne on the remix of Kanye West "Can't Tell Me Nothin"
vincent (1:29:00 PM):  looked it up
mara (1:29:17 PM):  well just ask if you dont get something... no hesitations needed
vincent (1:29:23 PM):  just ask if there's something you don't know
mara (1:29:27 PM):  awesome thanks
vincent (1:29:55 PM):  do you guys say "pwn"?  that one's weird to me.
mara (1:30:16 PM):  what is it?
george (1:30:20 PM):  ohh here it is, was looking up that band...it's LMFAO
shelly (1:30:41 PM):  I think pwn is an annoying teenage word. I think it's a misspelling of "own" as in "I owned you."
mara (1:30:45 PM):  my roommates mother makes up abbreviation for everything in chat.. you cant understand a damn thing she says without asking her lol
shelly (1:30:53 PM):  You say when you beat someone in a game.
vincent (1:31:00 PM):  it's pronounced "own" which is weird... and it means, like, to beat someone seriously at something... like to "school" them
george (1:31:00 PM):  i sometimes say "own" in rl, but not "pown"
mara (1:31:03 PM):  oh like rents, por parents
vincent (1:31:48 PM):  yeah rents.  I used to say that.
george (1:31:48 PM):  i've seen the use of pwn to describe anything unfortunate
michelle (1:32:06 PM):  really?
vincent (1:32:10 PM):  like that swimming just got pwned by that shark?
george (1:32:10 PM):  "a bird pooped on my jacket" "pwnd."
vincent (1:32:17 PM):  swimmer I mean
shelly (1:32:21 PM):  Wow, that's a completely different take on the word. Unfortunately, eh.
mara (1:32:26 PM):  what about "pffff" ? like the sound?
vincent (1:32:47 PM):  when is that used?
george (1:32:57 PM):  yea you can describe someone getting attacked by a shark as pwnd...it's kinda detached from humanity in its use tho hehe
mara (1:32:57 PM):  eh... ha where you from shelly?
shelly (1:33:03 PM):  Maybe to blow off something. Or say it's not important.
mara (1:33:12 PM):  like if you said something dumb... i would respond pff!
vincent (1:33:13 PM):  oh right.
mara (1:33:14 PM):  lol
george (1:33:21 PM):  pfft, yup
mara (1:33:23 PM):  that too
shelly (1:33:37 PM):  ouch
shelly (1:33:59 PM):  Okay, so we want to talk about Watchman or something more serious (my topic)?
george (1:34:10 PM):  has anybody heard of QQ?
vincent (1:34:11 PM):  what's your topic?
vincent (1:34:18 PM):  what's QQ?
george (1:34:31 PM):  those are two eyes, crying
george (1:34:48 PM):  if someone is complaining, you respond "QQ more" or just "qq"
mara (1:34:52 PM):  oh sooo cute george lol
vincent (1:35:01 PM):  cute
michelle (1:35:07 PM):  cute
vincent (1:35:17 PM):  it's sarcastic, usually?
vincent (1:35:20 PM):  must be.
shelly (1:35:21 PM):  I was going to raise some questions about what we're doing here. About the goals of this study.
mara (1:35:29 PM):  i would suspect so
george (1:35:39 PM):  yea it's sarcastic when used in response to someone
vincent (1:35:51 PM):  yeah, are you actually involved in the study, shelly?  like in the behind-the-scenes stuff?
george (1:36:02 PM):  but you can say "i just stepped in a puddle QQ"
shelly (1:36:03 PM):  Nope, I know what you know.
mara (1:36:04 PM):  oh thats a good topic... sarcasm in online chat!  I have such a hard time with that
vincent (1:36:07 PM):  this window being "the scenes" I guess
george (1:36:51 PM):  i usually don't have much difficulty with sarcasm in chat for some reason
george (1:37:07 PM):  maybe i'm missing most of it heh
mara (1:37:09 PM):  how do you get it george?  I never understand
mara (1:37:18 PM):  haha maybe!
vincent (1:37:20 PM):  yeah, I feel like I usually get it.
shelly (1:37:29 PM):  Hold on. So from the examples we've noted about chat abbrev., they are used mostly to express personality, not meaning. Sarcasm for example. That's interesting.
george (1:37:32 PM):  it might just be experience and knowing the people you're talking with
mara (1:38:08 PM):  right, but i chat with randoms sometime... sort of like blogging ya know?
george (1:38:14 PM):  well, i'll use different forms of lol depending on context and mood
vincent (1:38:16 PM):  they express meaning a little... but yeah, like there are other ways of expressing it, so using the abbrev is like, "this is my style"
mara (1:38:27 PM):  i know my friend, shes korean, she never picks up on it haha
george (1:38:39 PM):  ROFL is different and in caps, signifying a genuine laughing here
vincent (1:38:56 PM):  easy sarcasm is when things are grossy exaggerated.
george (1:39:21 PM):  lel lawl, etc...in lower case and deliberate misspelling signifies sarcasm or a joke that fizzled or just slightly funny
shelly (1:39:28 PM):  Hmmm. And adding style is hard in chat. It would be something that would be done with visual cues or sound inflections in real conversation.
vincent (1:39:47 PM):  or when there's subculture language used, slang
george (1:40:22 PM):  that's pretty much a good way of describing it...it's slang to people who use it all the time
mara (1:40:26 PM):  yeah but how so you know that, vincent, without what selx says is sound inflections?
mara (1:40:49 PM):  slang? because its not proper?
george (1:41:12 PM):  it's definitely not proper english!
mara (1:41:17 PM):  or perhaps well known?
vincent (1:41:22 PM):  when someone caricatures, like, stoner slang or something when they think someone's being dumb, "yeah, like... dude... totally, brah"
mara (1:41:45 PM):  brah... haha
shelly (1:42:01 PM):  But why would "color" or "personality" be important in a chat? Perhaps when the chatter is more interested in creating a mood or creating an impression more than conveying information?
shelly (1:42:25 PM):  Brah?
vincent (1:42:35 PM):  yeah, I feel like chat, even a lot of the texting (at least that I do), is more just small talk and jokes
vincent (1:42:49 PM):  brah is exaggerated surfer pronunciation of "bro"
shelly (1:43:07 PM):  Ah, good. Learned a new one.
mara (1:43:18 PM):  shelly, i think the sort of lack of personality cues from another can cause conflict that is not needed
george (1:43:37 PM):  i think alot of these things are an extension of the english language, words coined for precision within a subculture
shelly (1:43:46 PM):  mara, is that more likely than conflict caused by the personality?
mara (1:43:47 PM):  just say it to yourself... "Brah" its soo funny
vincent (1:44:18 PM):  I've seen this thing where someone makes a long, involved argument, like on a bulletin board...and then a person totally shuts it down by just typing "cool story, brah"
michelle (1:44:18 PM):  it is related to affective aspects in an interactive design product, such as chat
mara (1:44:34 PM):  i think so... if you misunderstand someones connotations because you dont know their personality well ya know?
michelle (1:44:53 PM):  It is true
shelly (1:45:18 PM):  Huh? You lost me michelle. Affective aspects?
mara (1:45:20 PM):  i agree michelle
george (1:45:27 PM):  i wonder if it's possible to mistake "brah" for an undergarment if the person has never been called that
michelle (1:45:38 PM):  do you know what this icon means?   :x
vincent (1:45:46 PM):  yeah, out loud it is, for sure.
shelly (1:45:50 PM):  Nope.
vincent (1:45:56 PM):  I don't.
george (1:46:01 PM):  a face with puckered lips
michelle (1:46:05 PM):  in a book, it was denoted as "sick, not feeling well"
mara (1:46:13 PM):  haha george, not if you say it like a surfer ya know?
vincent (1:46:14 PM):  like, "kiss me"?
vincent (1:46:28 PM):  oh, sick?  I don't see it.
shelly (1:46:38 PM):  Kiss me, or sick. Pretty different interpretations.
mara (1:47:00 PM):  yeah i would think... throwing up or puking kind of sick ha
michelle (1:47:10 PM):  regarding affective aspects of interaction design, it incluses emoticons, virtual pets, etc. some abbreviations are also included, like the one I just mentioned
mara (1:47:13 PM):  :P
george (1:47:14 PM):  i thought :x was used to denote blushing...not sure now heh
mara (1:47:21 PM):  what about that one... : P
mara (1:47:37 PM):  could be!
michelle (1:47:41 PM):  laugh, I guess, happy
george (1:47:42 PM):  tongue is sticking out
shelly (1:47:48 PM):  I think of :P as sticking your tongue out.
vincent (1:47:51 PM):  affective, like "affectation," specific way of talking?
george (1:47:58 PM):  :P ~~~  (drooling)
mara (1:48:02 PM):  yeah george thats what i would use it for
mara (1:48:15 PM):  like teasing... like ha ha
michelle (1:48:20 PM):  vincent, I think it is similar.
shelly (1:48:24 PM):  I like the drooling one.
vincent (1:48:41 PM):  I see.
george (1:48:41 PM):  i've seen it used after telling something funny...can't think of the word for it
george (1:48:44 PM):  smug?
george (1:48:55 PM):  smug?
mara (1:49:03 PM):  there are so many... im not good at making a lot of the expressive faces i just know like four
mara (1:49:08 PM):  and i use them all the time!
vincent (1:49:20 PM):  I never got into the faces.
george (1:49:26 PM):  8,-((
mara (1:49:40 PM):  a bouble chin?
mara (1:49:42 PM):  ha
shelly (1:49:50 PM):  Okay, so I think I understand what "affective aspects" is now. What are you relating that too, michelle?
george (1:49:55 PM):  just a crying face
george (1:50:05 PM):  ^_^
vincent (1:50:07 PM):  I guess I kind of feel like people should already know when I'm joking, or whatever?
mara (1:50:08 PM):  i can see it now george
mara (1:50:42 PM):  but i don't know you at all... what if i assume incorrectly?
george (1:50:44 PM):  i think they are going to have a good time parsing our chat today
shelly (1:50:56 PM):  Why should they already know that, vincent? Isn't that asking alot?
mara (1:51:18 PM):  i agree shelly!
vincent (1:51:32 PM):  maybe it is, yeah.  It's kind of like this thing I've noticed, East Coast / West Coast difference...
michelle (1:51:43 PM):  shelly, I believe most things we discussed today can be under this "affective" umbrella. Also, the issues around it can be related to chat itself, and how to design a better collaborative tool in the future
george (1:51:45 PM):  i think the more we use these emoticons, the more you'll get the hang of it and be able to understand the underlying sarcasm/emotions/etc
mara (1:51:52 PM):  like i said i study interpersonal comm. but i stink at this non-face to face stuff... too much left for interpretation
vincent (1:51:55 PM):  since I moved out here, I can say something that I think is so obviously a joke, and people are like "oh, really?"
shelly (1:52:26 PM):  LOL. So West Coasters are more intuitive chatters, eh?
shelly (1:52:43 PM):  Or other way around?
vincent (1:52:49 PM):  I think of the emoticons as the equivalent of saying "just kidding," which I never had to say before I moved out here
michelle (1:53:04 PM):  we need statistics to support it, shelly
vincent (1:53:07 PM):  other way around!  West Costers are more earnest maybe?  they don't get the sarcasm
vincent (1:53:31 PM):  not as quickly.  but yeah, maybe online I should learn to say "just kidding."
george (1:53:41 PM):  are west coasters more into slapstick than sarcasm?
mara (1:53:48 PM):  the sun has fried their brains
mara (1:54:08 PM):  eww i love slapstick
george (1:54:13 PM):  like 3 stooges humor hyuk hyuk
mara (1:54:18 PM):  the three musketeers are the best
mara (1:54:25 PM):  i meant stooges haha
shelly (1:54:32 PM):  Interesting. I don't know many West Coasters. I skeptical of broad generalizations however. Maybe you're just too subtle vincent.
george (1:54:41 PM):  i like benny hill :P
mara (1:54:51 PM):  oh ditto
vincent (1:54:53 PM):  Of course, it's not everyone!
shelly (1:55:02 PM):  Benny's seriously subtle!
mara (1:55:18 PM):  its ok to have a sociology aspect when dealing with people esp. with cultures
vincent (1:55:28 PM):  the fast-motion chasing around with the funny music!  subtle!
george (1:55:42 PM):  i guess there's subtle aspects, but not when he's slapping the old bald dude on the head!
shelly (1:55:57 PM):  the scantily clad women. Subtle!
mara (1:56:05 PM):  anyone seen trailer park boys?
vincent (1:56:10 PM):  or chasing the topless ladies around.
shelly (1:56:30 PM):  Nope. What's trailer park boys?
vincent (1:56:40 PM):  no, that's a Canadian show?
mara (1:57:09 PM):  yeah it is
mara (1:57:20 PM):  im from canada...
shelly (1:57:31 PM):  I'm so sorry. ;)
mara (1:57:32 PM):  i recommend it for the humorous ones
george (1:57:36 PM):  what part of canada?
mara (1:58:01 PM):  quebec city
george (1:58:20 PM):  ohh so you must know what poutine is
vincent (1:58:23 PM):  I spend a little time in Montreal every so often... I like it there
mara (1:58:32 PM):  haha, yes and i love it!
george (1:58:36 PM):  i'd like some poutine right now in fact!
michelle (1:58:36 PM):  nice city
mara (1:58:46 PM):  me too! montreal is where i party when im not in albany
shelly (1:58:51 PM):  Poutine?
mara (1:59:02 PM):  french fries with cheese and gravy
michelle (1:59:02 PM):  co-ask
mara (1:59:14 PM):  i prefer beef gravy if you are going to make me some too george!
shelly (1:59:17 PM):  Yum. And so bad for you.
michelle (1:59:19 PM):  got it
george (1:59:26 PM):  yea, it's an artery clogger but sooo good
shelly (1:59:39 PM):  Add bacon and you've really got something.
george (1:59:56 PM):  haha i'd make some if i cou.ld!
mara (1:59:58 PM):  canadian bacon is the best!
shelly (2:00:06 PM):  Then again, add bacon to pretty much anything and it's better.
vincent (2:00:10 PM):  I had  a veggie version of poutine... pretty great.
michelle (2:00:11 PM):  I love it too
george (2:00:12 PM):  next best thing is the cheese fries at outback
michelle (2:00:19 PM):  shelly, good idea
george (2:00:20 PM):  cheese, bacon, ranch sauce
mara (2:00:36 PM):  eww except this one time i had potato salad and there was bacon in it... worst thing ever!
george (2:01:08 PM):  fake bacon tastes like toxic waste (or how i imagine toxic waste would taste)
mara (2:01:15 PM):  everyone is diggin' the ranch dressing lately.  My ex eats it with EVERYTHING! no exageration there
vincent (2:01:25 PM):  cereal?
vincent (2:01:39 PM):  cake?
george (2:01:40 PM):  haha
mara (2:01:49 PM):  haha he doesnt eat cereal actually
george (2:01:58 PM):  straberries and kiwi...with RANCH DRESSING!!!
vincent (2:01:59 PM):  because it's not good with Ranch.
mara (2:02:07 PM):  nice tho vincent! I guess you caught me lying
shelly (2:02:08 PM):  Yuck.
vincent (2:02:30 PM):  can't slip one past me.
vincent (2:02:54 PM):  but back to another topic, kind of... those are obvious jokes, right?  like, obviously exaggerated things?
mara (2:03:05 PM):  damn, i guess no!  But i will have lots of other chances,we will be chatting for a while
mara (2:03:26 PM):  yes i believe so
george (2:04:03 PM):  we still have 25 minutes i think right?
shelly (2:04:20 PM):  We do. Time for Watchman discussion?
mara (2:04:20 PM):  yes sir...
vincent (2:04:22 PM):  so that's a start, one way to do chat humor is exaggeration.
george (2:04:28 PM):  that hour went pretty fast
george (2:04:31 PM):  imo
mara (2:04:38 PM):  good!
michelle (2:04:45 PM):  yes, time flies
george (2:04:46 PM):  yea watchmen was very cool
vincent (2:04:54 PM):  sure... I was not totally bummed out by the Watchmen movie like I thought I would be...
george (2:04:59 PM):  what was that guy's name with the trench coat?
shelly (2:05:06 PM):  So, me, michelle, and mara haven't seen it right?
vincent (2:05:08 PM):  I kind of thought I would hate it, because I'm so attached to the book
mara (2:05:16 PM):  i saw it
michelle (2:05:25 PM):  right, shelly
mara (2:05:32 PM):  i went to a screening remember... for FREE!
mara (2:05:39 PM):  thats the only way i would watch that movie again
vincent (2:05:43 PM):  Rorschach
mara (2:05:59 PM):  he was ugly without that mask ha
george (2:06:05 PM):  oh, so if we discuss it; be some spoilers
shelly (2:06:09 PM):  Why would you hate a movie, if you loved a book? They are different medium and ways of telling a story? Do you expect the movie to convey the same emotions and impressions as the book? That seems unwise to me.
george (2:06:09 PM):  don't want to ruin it for you
shelly (2:06:37 PM):  Don't worry about spoilers for me. I know the story.
mara (2:06:55 PM):  yeah because i would totally be talking about the ending.. i wont tell you but i was upset
vincent (2:06:56 PM):  I'll try to do no spoiling... I think there's so much in the book, so many layers, so much stuff that wouldn't really translate well to film...
michelle (2:07:21 PM):  who is the director
mara (2:07:22 PM):  i never read the book
shelly (2:07:24 PM):  Right. The book will always be deeper than the movie. It's a matter of time and space to  tell the story.
mara (2:07:26 PM):  have you vincent?
vincent (2:07:33 PM):  like all the inter-chapter stuff... the fake primary sources... and that provides so many extra layers that you can't really fit into the film
shelly (2:07:35 PM):  Snyder? The guy who did 300?
vincent (2:07:42 PM):  for sure
george (2:07:42 PM):  that movie was not what i was expecting from a super hero movie...it's like most superhero stories are black and white...the entire movie this time was grey
vincent (2:07:51 PM):  yeah, a few times
vincent (2:08:05 PM):  yeah, and Dawn of the Dead remake... not a really subtle director
michelle (2:08:05 PM):  thanks, shelly
shelly (2:08:18 PM):  And so you get teh point of Watchmen. The reason it's a classic is that it turns the superhero genre on its head.
vincent (2:08:55 PM):  yeah, that's the whole thing... my friend Paul reviewed it for the Seattle paper... he said that since the Watchmen comic basically changed everything in comics, made every other superheo comic look shallow and small and silly...
shelly (2:08:56 PM):  It was one of the first that did so. Superheroes, if you think about it, are nutso.
shelly (2:09:14 PM):  Anyone who is willing to do what they do has got to be more than a bit crazy.
mara (2:09:16 PM):  i liked the overall story, but there were issues for me that run deeper like bad acting! ugh
vincent (2:09:20 PM):  that this movie, to be right, should make every other Superhero move look like that, too...
george (2:09:54 PM):  haha who did you think did the bulk of the bad acting?
vincent (2:10:02 PM):  silk spectre!!!
shelly (2:10:07 PM):  Well, bad acting or poorly executed plot. That's a problem. It wasnt' the case with the book, but translation is not easy.
mara (2:10:24 PM):  lol she was a little on the slow side i felt
mara (2:10:48 PM):  that guy the blonde business one
mara (2:10:51 PM):  i forget his name
george (2:10:58 PM):  how about her mom?
mara (2:10:59 PM):  he was the worst to me! worst ever
shelly (2:11:01 PM):  I not overly sensitive to bad acting. I guess it's only a problem if it takes you out of the movie and makes you think the character is clearly and actor reading lines. Did Silk Specter do that?
vincent (2:11:03 PM):  Rorschach was perfect... his voice was exactly what I pictured
vincent (2:11:05 PM):  Ozymandias
george (2:11:24 PM):  adrian?
vincent (2:11:26 PM):  she was pretty wooden
vincent (2:11:35 PM):  yeah, Adrian - Ozy...
shelly (2:11:44 PM):  Haily (sp?) is very good. Very creepy, but very good.
vincent (2:11:58 PM):  who's Haily?
shelly (2:12:14 PM):  I think of Ozymandias as the most wooden of the characters. Did the actor convey that?
mara (2:12:18 PM):  eh she wasnt in it too much to say, but she was ugly! I guess if i was a superhero half my life i would look run down too
vincent (2:12:37 PM):  yeah, cold, calculating...
shelly (2:12:42 PM):  The actor who played Rorschach.
george (2:13:08 PM):  rorschach reminded me alot of wolverine
vincent (2:13:25 PM):  yeah, I thought he was great.  especially the mask-off sections... like he's so used to his mask that he doesn't have facial expressions
george (2:13:33 PM):  personality wise
mara (2:13:46 PM):  that was a cool aspect really
vincent (2:13:58 PM):  Wolverine isn't as black and white in his morality as rorschach... maybe more the Punisher (bad guys are bad guys, and we kill bad guys)
shelly (2:14:11 PM):  Yah, Wolverine was the Marvel-cleaned up version of a nasty hero. Probably why he's so popular. He's a badass and a pretty ugly individual.
vincent (2:14:13 PM):  but Rorscach is short and brutal like Wolverine!
mara (2:14:31 PM):  "what do you see?"
mara (2:14:45 PM):  made me laugh... he was a hostile man! one of my favs i have to say
george (2:15:02 PM):  rorscach's determination is like that of wolverine's and they both hate compromise
vincent (2:15:22 PM):  Rorschach was more immediately likeable in the movie... the comic was like a fight the whole time, you want to keep him out of your head, and then you finally let him in, sympathize, very near the end
shelly (2:15:42 PM):  Y'know, as far as his mask goes, that's an area where the movie has it all over the comic. You can't get the creepiness of the roving Rorschach mark in the still medium of the comic.
mara (2:15:47 PM):  i never saw any XMEN film lol or read it
vincent (2:16:01 PM):  yeah, the movement of the mask was great.
george (2:16:03 PM):  i felt that way about the movie...he was kinda portrayed in a suspicious light for most of the movie
vincent (2:16:26 PM):  they didn't explain in the movie where his mask came from, which I thought was a cool section
vincent (2:17:01 PM):  and one of my favorite characters was the news stand guys and the comic book kid, and they just get a little cameo at the end
mara (2:17:03 PM):  tell me vincent, where?
vincent (2:17:09 PM):  I mean two of my favorite
vincent (2:18:14 PM):  one of the first crimes he tried to stop or solve (it's a little fuzzy in my memory) was the murder of this fashion model, and they designed her a dress with this weird ink inside it that moved around... and rorschach failed and she got killed, so he cuts up her dress to make his mask
vincent (2:18:47 PM):  is that mostly right, shelly?
shelly (2:19:11 PM):  Sorry, hold on.
mara (2:19:19 PM):  cool
mara (2:19:29 PM):  sounds interesting for sure
shelly (2:20:13 PM):  That sounds right vincent.
george (2:20:18 PM):  *poke* michelle
mara (2:20:24 PM):  should we make a top for next  time
vincent (2:20:27 PM):  the book is really amazing, there's so much in it.  it's really, like... literary and heavy and philosophical.
mara (2:20:34 PM):  we only have 8 mins left
vincent (2:20:38 PM):  yeah, time to stop?
shelly (2:20:43 PM):  Poor michelle. We've left her out of the discussion.
vincent (2:20:53 PM):  sorry michelle!  next time we talk about things you like!
michelle (2:21:05 PM):  fine with me
mara (2:21:10 PM):  yeah michelle propose a topic
shelly (2:21:13 PM):  I agree vincent. I would recommend that everyone read it. I would be particularly interested to hear mara's impression having seen the movie first.
michelle (2:21:13 PM):  I learned a great deal about the movie
george (2:21:28 PM):  i might have OCD but i feel bad if i leave a few min late
michelle (2:21:37 PM):  economy nex time?
vincent (2:21:48 PM):  sure!
george (2:21:49 PM):  er early
michelle (2:21:57 PM):  I will watch the movie soon
george (2:22:02 PM):  ohh i have alot to say about economy haha
mara (2:22:06 PM):  yeah sure economy.. i need to read the newspaper tonight then haha
mara (2:22:12 PM):  and i will read the book
george (2:22:23 PM):  must...hunt...the bankers...
mara (2:22:24 PM):  i dont have much time right now with school and such but ill get around to it
vincent (2:22:27 PM):  yeah!
shelly (2:22:31 PM):  Okay, so we're supposed to talk about the next session's topic. I'm out for tomorrow's session however. I'm not on again until Friday next week most likely. Too much stuff to do. Who's around tomorrow?
vincent (2:22:43 PM):  it'll still be there
george (2:22:50 PM):  i'd like to suggest looking up Max Keiser on the economy
vincent (2:22:53 PM):  I'm signed up for tomorrow.
michelle (2:23:14 PM):  tomorrow? I am not sure.
george (2:23:20 PM):  he's an ex-broker and describes what is going on in great detail from a perspective you don't get from most news sources
shelly (2:23:20 PM):  Did moderator ask anyone to be discussion leader for tomorrow?
mara (2:23:28 PM):  me me me
vincent (2:23:33 PM):  no
michelle (2:23:43 PM):  no
vincent (2:23:56 PM):  mara, you want it?
michelle (2:24:09 PM):  how many discussions should we join?
mara (2:24:09 PM):  jennys got it
mara (2:24:10 PM):  lol
vincent (2:24:24 PM):  I think they wanted us for a total of 7.
michelle (2:24:28 PM):  a little confused on the schedule
michelle (2:24:38 PM):  r u sure?
shelly (2:24:42 PM):  As many as you can, I guess. I can't imagine everyone will make every session. Certainly not me.
george (2:24:53 PM):  unfortunately i can't make it tomorrow...will i see any of you on sunday?
michelle (2:24:58 PM):  me either
vincent (2:25:06 PM):  I'm also here Sunday, I think.
mara (2:25:07 PM):  me either! look at the schedule you should get a nice idea
vincent (2:25:26 PM):  link
shelly (2:25:28 PM):  I'll try to stop in Sunday but some course of mine has a bunch of homework due that day. ;)

mara (1:06:47 PM):  no but if you paste a link ill check out whatever
vincent (1:06:51 PM):  So, I can see you guys are already talking about stuff... but I was asked to "lead" today...
mara (1:06:57 PM):  does anyone watch American Idol?
rachael (1:07:23 PM):  vincent, we were just chatting.  Lead on!
vincent (1:07:23 PM):  I haven't had a television (that gets tv stations) in lots of years.
mara (1:07:49 PM):  vincent, we were just discussing music because yesterday I told them I was going to a concert in NC for Death Cab for Cutie... nothing too important if you got stuff to say
mara (1:08:04 PM):  yeah george either! haha : P
george (1:08:30 PM):  i checked out death cab for cutie just now, sounds pretty good
vincent (1:08:43 PM):  Not really, I thought of following up on the travel topic we touched on yesterday.  Do you all travel a little or a lot?  Like it?  Want to do it more?
vincent (1:08:57 PM):  Hate it?
rachael (1:09:07 PM):  Does back and forth to work count?
mara (1:09:18 PM):  im glad i started a new love for this band haha
vincent (1:09:23 PM):  yes, very focused travel.
mara (1:09:23 PM):  haha rachael!
george (1:09:26 PM):  i've travelled before, in general i've had a good time but i don't feel the urge to do much more :P
mara (1:09:33 PM):  its your husband who doesn like it, right?
george (1:09:44 PM):  i lived in japan for 7 years
mara (1:09:58 PM):  cool!
vincent (1:10:03 PM):  what part?
mara (1:10:04 PM):  where in Japan?
rachael (1:10:10 PM):  Well, I'mo not in a traveling mood.  I laways want to sleep in my own bed.
george (1:10:18 PM):  me?
vincent (1:10:26 PM):  yeah, where in Japan?
george (1:10:27 PM):  ah, kyoto for 1 year, tokyo for 6
mara (1:10:30 PM):  oh me too! i love my bed
rachael (1:10:42 PM):  Tell us about Japan,  Why were you there?
george (1:11:14 PM):  my father was doing research, brought my mother and me along :P
george (1:11:29 PM):  i miss the food there quite a bit...and the conveniences
rachael (1:11:30 PM):  What does :P mean?
george (1:11:48 PM):  that's a tongue sticking out of my mouth
vincent (1:11:58 PM):  what conveniences?
george (1:12:03 PM):  trying to think of the word to describe what that conveys
vincent (1:12:15 PM):  nyah nyah?
george (1:12:25 PM):  well, public transportation there is amazing...and there's vending machines EVERYWHERE
vincent (1:12:56 PM):  oh yeah! they have weird vending machines?  like you could get... video games and sanwiches?
mara (1:13:00 PM):  do their vending machines have very diffrent things than in america?
mara (1:13:10 PM):  haha yeah vincent! I want to know too
rachael (1:13:13 PM):  The vending machines have things other than canday bars?
rachael (1:13:21 PM):  *candy
mara (1:13:26 PM):  beer?
george (1:13:44 PM):  you can get magazines, alcohol, cigarettes, snacks, and other stuff
george (1:14:09 PM):  panty hose too in fact, if you get a run and need a change
vincent (1:14:11 PM):  that's cool.
rachael (1:14:12 PM):  No age laws for cigarettes and alcohol?
mara (1:14:16 PM):  so weird!
george (1:14:21 PM):  (not that i have a use for that particular convenience)
mara (1:14:39 PM):  yeah sure you don't george!
mara (1:14:43 PM):  :D
vincent (1:14:44 PM):  yeah, is it more European?  pretty much anyone can drink?
george (1:14:52 PM):  you're supposed to be 20, but they can't enforce it everywhere
rachael (1:14:55 PM):  That's strange.  The  age law is my question, but it didn't show my name.
george (1:14:59 PM):  oh noez, mara sees right through me!
vincent (1:15:06 PM):  I sw your name
mara (1:15:17 PM):  ditto
vincent (1:15:20 PM):  you're busted, george.
vincent (1:15:38 PM):  look!  online sarcasm that came across!
mara (1:15:43 PM):  did you do alot of site seeing?
george (1:15:45 PM):  dang, it's out...gonna have to move again!
rachael (1:15:48 PM):  So rare.
george (1:16:50 PM):  yea i did some sight seeing in japan, but i probably did more elsewhere
rachael (1:17:02 PM):  What was your dad's research on?
george (1:17:17 PM):  toxoplasmosis
vincent (1:17:32 PM):  wow
george (1:17:37 PM):  parasitic disease, he was a parasitologist
rachael (1:17:49 PM):  Why did it have to be done in Japan?
vincent (1:18:06 PM):  that's kind of scary, I always think about "lab accidents" with stuff like that... can't help it
george (1:18:31 PM):  it didn't really...he used to work for NY dept of health, but he happens to love Japan and got the opportunity to go out there
vincent (1:18:41 PM):  cool.
mara (1:18:47 PM):  hopefully they were well trained so things like that wouldnt happen vincent
george (1:18:51 PM):  if your immune system is functioning properly you probably don't have much to worry about
mara (1:18:56 PM):  or could be prevented in most cases i guess
rachael (1:19:12 PM):  Not many vending machine conveniences in NY!
vincent (1:19:23 PM):  I just saw this Korean film called The Host, about some lab workers who pour some stuff down the drain, and it mmutates fish in the river
vincent (1:19:49 PM):  funny/scary
mara (1:19:57 PM):  Yeah i've heard of that phenomenan becfore
mara (1:20:01 PM):  before*
george (1:20:03 PM):  you watch a lot of korean film?
rachael (1:20:17 PM):  A fiendish terrorist plt?  We live near the AShokan reservoir, and security is there to prevent people from doing that.
vincent (1:20:31 PM):  a pretty good amount, not way more than the films of other countries
george (1:20:44 PM):  have you seen old boy?
vincent (1:21:01 PM):  yeah, that movie is awesome, but it will totally ruin your day.
mara (1:21:15 PM):  i live between a river and a brook and my father is always cleaning out peoeples waste!
rachael (1:21:17 PM):  How will it ruin your day?
vincent (1:21:24 PM):  oh no!
george (1:21:27 PM):  i got into korean film for a while, you mentioning it makes me want to go look for what's been coming out
mara (1:21:28 PM):  I dont think I want to know...
vincent (1:21:54 PM):  It's super violent, physical and psychological... dark... torture, incest, gang violence, squid eating
rachael (1:22:02 PM):  Maybe I shouldn't have asked!
vincent (1:22:02 PM):  not fun
george (1:22:13 PM):  lol
rachael (1:22:22 PM):  Squid eating; that's the last straw.
vincent (1:22:41 PM):  yeah, that's where most people draw the line!
rachael (1:22:52 PM):  LOL
vincent (1:23:10 PM):  nice semicolon, that's a lost art in most chat.
george (1:23:23 PM):  bbq squid is good! :(
vincent (1:23:48 PM):  but the squid (or whatever it was) in that movie was like grabbing at the guy's face!
rachael (1:23:55 PM):  Just the name takes it off the menu - squid.
vincent (1:23:57 PM):  grosssssssssss.
george (1:24:00 PM):  ohh baby octopus probably
george (1:24:12 PM):  koreans dig that for some reason
vincent (1:24:27 PM):  did you hear they finally really found a Giant Squid?
george (1:25:05 PM):  alive?
mara (1:25:08 PM):  is the grudge film... of asian culture?
vincent (1:25:23 PM):  yeah alive.  yeah, that's Japanese.
mara (1:25:24 PM):  ive never seen it, but i hear it has that sort of weird stuff you were talking about in it
mara (1:25:57 PM):  I'm the biggest chicken shit ever so I couldnt watch anything like that
george (1:26:01 PM):  i've never seen that; i probably should
vincent (1:26:23 PM):  The Host is mostly a comedy, there's a big monster, but it's a funny parody of U.S. military stuff, and "terrorism threat"... it's pretty smart.
mara (1:26:27 PM):  but the saw movies are a different story... LOVE LOVE LOVE them
george (1:26:34 PM):  have you seen the saw series?  that's right there at the top...made in the good ole USA
rachael (1:26:36 PM):  I couldn't either.  And I don't like to be scared, so that leaves a lot out.
vincent (1:26:55 PM):  really?  I only saw the first SAW, and thought it was kind of half-assed.  and I like horror.
george (1:27:08 PM):  saw is overflowing with cruelty!
vincent (1:27:17 PM):  for sure.
mara (1:27:46 PM):  i saw them all so far
rachael (1:28:08 PM):  No Saw.  I did find out I like Bollywood and Jet Li, but that's it.  Although the films coming out of Afghanistan and Iran are god.
george (1:28:23 PM):  i saw up to 3; didn't feel 4 and 5 would be worth watching based on the first 3
rachael (1:28:25 PM):  *good
mara (1:28:30 PM):  i dont think its horrow its more psychological... what do you call it?
vincent (1:28:54 PM):  I didn't like the "cop story" stuff they tried to tack onto it.
mara (1:28:56 PM):  what the Kite movie rachael? do you know what im talking about?
george (1:29:04 PM):  suspense?
vincent (1:29:13 PM):  something like Texas Chainsaw stands on its own without subplots
mara (1:29:21 PM):  ha maybe... suspense sounds close to what im thinking
rachael (1:29:28 PM):  Yes, I liked Osama (the movie!) better, but Kite was good.
mara (1:29:34 PM):  thats a true story tho..
vincent (1:29:38 PM):  where in the world is Osama?
vincent (1:29:49 PM):  that one?
mara (1:29:50 PM):  Kite Runner... that movie! you seen it?
george (1:29:53 PM):  osama the movie?  :o
vincent (1:30:04 PM):  I haven't yet, my mom just read the book and was crazy about it.
rachael (1:30:32 PM):  At your local video store.  The movie is about a girl who takes that name in order to be able to masquerade as a boy and get a job.
vincent (1:30:49 PM):  oh! cool. I'll look for it.
vincent (1:31:08 PM):  When I'm home, I sometimes fill in at this cool indie video store that has tons of foreign stuff.
rachael (1:31:15 PM):  It too could ruin your day though.
vincent (1:31:33 PM):  the middle east is putting out some heavy stuff... no surprise.
vincent (1:31:55 PM):  Eastern Europe, too, the Balkans... every movie they make is heartbreaking
rachael (1:32:32 PM):  I think it's healthy.  Better to make a movie than continue accepting things as they are.
george (1:32:39 PM):  eastern europe has the blues...their morgages are collapsing :(
vincent (1:32:43 PM):  yeah!
vincent (1:32:54 PM):  and long histories of civil wars, etc.
rachael (1:33:14 PM):  I didn't know eastern europe even  had mortgages.
vincent (1:33:20 PM):  ethnic wars
rachael (1:33:29 PM):  old grudges
george (1:34:00 PM):  they took out mortgages in yen, because there was a 1% interest rate...however, the yen appreciated vs their local currencies and that bankrupted them
vincent (1:34:16 PM):  ow.
rachael (1:34:26 PM):  Eastern european mortgages in yen?
george (1:34:37 PM):  and euros
mara (1:34:50 PM):  better than the dollar!
george (1:35:06 PM):  sterling is worse still
vincent (1:35:07 PM):  do you guys know about Eurovision?  the pop song contest?
george (1:35:13 PM):  UK is doomed :(
rachael (1:35:19 PM):  Is it?  I was just thinking we might be better with the $ in spite of everything.
george (1:35:34 PM):  $ might be doomed as well
mara (1:35:40 PM):  no vincent...
mara (1:35:49 PM):  yeah so far, so doomed!
mara (1:35:51 PM):  lol
george (1:36:01 PM):  if china stops buying our treasuries then bond market collapse, then shortly after $ will collapse
rachael (1:36:12 PM):  Eurovision - vaguely,  Wasn't there some recent controversy?
mara (1:36:13 PM):  AWW there is so much going on at my house right now... sorry if i seem lost in convo.
rachael (1:37:06 PM):  I remembered the stipend told my kids about it.  They hushed.
george (1:37:12 PM):  i don't know anything about the pop song contest :(
mara (1:37:29 PM):  well when i visited Spain I noticed that meals cost the same, which is double the dollar, and the portions are much smaller... so we pay double for less
george (1:38:42 PM):  haha if you ever get a chance to visit japan and find yourself in a mcdonald's, try ordering a small orange juice at breakfast
george (1:38:49 PM):  it's literally like a double shot of orange juice
rachael (1:38:54 PM):  How much?
george (1:39:23 PM):  oh gosh, i can't remember the price...maybe 300 yen?  $3?
vincent (1:39:25 PM):  it's working now.
george (1:40:27 PM):  you know they got a different menu in japan
vincent (1:40:33 PM):  okay, last thing:  it's just weird and interesting that governments are staking their financial future on supporting these weird pop stars at Eurovision... strange and twisted up priorities.  kind of cool.
george (1:40:36 PM):  link
mara (1:40:57 PM):  dont they serve beer at some mcd's
vincent (1:40:57 PM):  it's like Royale w/ Cheese in Pup Fiction
mara (1:41:02 PM):  in europe
george (1:41:11 PM):  yea i think they do in europe
rachael (1:41:28 PM):  Eurovision is govt supported?
george (1:41:33 PM):  in quebec, i think they serve poutine
mara (1:41:46 PM):  funny george!
rachael (1:41:53 PM):  IS the the cheese/fries special?
rachael (1:42:02 PM):  *that
mara (1:42:04 PM):  yes gravy too rachael
george (1:42:12 PM):  yup and gravy
rachael (1:42:22 PM):  I'll put that on the list with squid.
vincent (1:42:33 PM):  I never go to fast food places in the U.S., so I don't really know the difference enough to check them out in Europe.
george (1:42:43 PM):  i like squid too!
mara (1:42:49 PM):  oh man calamari issss sooooooo goooodddddd
mara (1:43:24 PM):  whatever you do don't eat it at the Olive Garden... its just not good enough and it will give you the right impression
george (1:43:45 PM):  is that the squid with vinegar?
vincent (1:43:50 PM):  yeah, Olive Garden could never beat a real Italian place
rachael (1:44:04 PM):  Never been to an Olive Garden.  The commercials are annoying somehow.
george (1:44:21 PM):  is there a real italian place in albany?  buccas maybe?
vincent (1:44:36 PM):  don't know... but NYC is not far from you guys!
rachael (1:44:47 PM):  You could check chowhound.com
mara (1:44:53 PM):  umm not sure i am lead to believe there is because there are alot of italians there haha
george (1:44:57 PM):  true
george (1:45:00 PM):  and boston
mara (1:45:12 PM):  only been to NYC twice in my life
mara (1:45:23 PM):  take that back... 3 times!
mara (1:45:29 PM):  and i have no dream of going again
rachael (1:45:34 PM):  What did you do there?
vincent (1:45:41 PM):  it's one of my favorites.  I've given Boston lots of tries, wanted to like it, can't get into it.
vincent (1:45:57 PM):  NY, I mean, is a favorite
mara (1:46:00 PM):  the first time was going for a friends 21st bday
george (1:46:10 PM):  you a yanks fan?  :P
mara (1:46:15 PM):  the second time was there visiting a guy i dated for his birthday
rachael (1:46:24 PM):  Yes to Yanks
mara (1:46:29 PM):  and a third time visited for a Giants/COwboys game
vincent (1:46:38 PM):  NY is all birthdays for you!
vincent (1:46:42 PM):  oh, not all.
mara (1:46:46 PM):  im a yanky fan too... so only been to NYC for bdays basically
george (1:46:53 PM):  me too i like yanks but still like boston...just not the redsox
rachael (1:46:59 PM):  mara, try just walking around.  I love NY, to coin a phrase,
vincent (1:47:06 PM):  I think that'll be my next place to live... Brooklyn.
rachael (1:47:14 PM):  $$$$
vincent (1:47:36 PM):  I know... there's still some cheaper, not-yet-hip neighborhoods
rachael (1:47:56 PM):  I would never live there, but I love Baltimore.  Great baseball stadium.
mara (1:47:57 PM):  haha nice rachael : D
vincent (1:48:39 PM):  I like Baltimore too.
mara (1:48:41 PM):  no i can barely take the city life of albany to be honest
mara (1:48:48 PM):  im from the sticks so its a change for me...
rachael (1:49:05 PM):  Boston just seems impenetrable.  I would like to like it, buit can't.
vincent (1:49:10 PM):  yeah, it can be overwhelming.  I grew up in a really small town and hated it, needed to escape.
vincent (1:49:37 PM):  everything closes really early in Boston, and people (generalization) seem really aggressive and kind of bummed-out
rachael (1:49:42 PM):  Albany doesn't seem like a city to me.
george (1:49:58 PM):  i've lived in tokyo and chicago most my life...albany is a nice change in pace for me
rachael (1:50:11 PM):  Maybe real cities don't have malls, and Albany seems to be all mall.
vincent (1:50:12 PM):  Seattle has started to not even really feel like a city to me... it's a small town in disguise
mara (1:50:45 PM):  well compared to where i live its all city haha
george (1:50:50 PM):  are you in seattle right now?
rachael (1:50:56 PM):  Whn we moved from Manhattan to this town of 6,000, I missed the neighborhood feeling.
vincent (1:51:05 PM):  I live there, yes, but right now I'm in Oakland, CA.
vincent (1:51:29 PM):  which very much feels like a real city.
george (1:51:36 PM):  ah ok...btw does it really rain alot in seattle?  i've been hearing that
vincent (1:52:10 PM):  Basically, when it's snowing in Upstate NY, it's raining in Seattle.  Then it's sunny and beautiful the rest of the year.
vincent (1:52:18 PM):  We get snow like one day a year.
vincent (1:52:33 PM):  and then everyone freaks out and goes sledding in the streets!
mara (1:52:36 PM):  i would be depressed becuase i love snow and hate rain
mara (1:52:38 PM):  lol
george (1:52:48 PM):  nice nice hehe
rachael (1:52:50 PM):  Sounds nice.  I'm tired of the muddy icy end-of-winter.
mara (1:52:51 PM):  haha thats like in NC
vincent (1:52:56 PM):  I miss the snow.  We have to drive out to the mountains if we really want it.
vincent (1:53:16 PM):  what's like NC?
mara (1:53:17 PM):  people are still skiing where I am
mara (1:53:30 PM):  I am home now, not in albany by the way just came herelast night
mara (1:53:46 PM):  the freak snow storms make people crazy about winter sports!
vincent (1:53:47 PM):  in Quebec City?
vincent (1:54:07 PM):  yeah!  the whole city shuts down because no one thinks they can drive in snow!
mara (1:54:13 PM):  nope thats where i was born, im in Plattsburgh, NY right now... its near Lake Placid
vincent (1:54:24 PM):  so the streets are all empty, and the hilly streets become sledding hills.  fun craziness.
george (1:54:34 PM):  mara, you're from quebec, right?
mara (1:54:35 PM):  thats the worst... first snow fall of the year everyone crashes can't remember how to drive UGH!
mara (1:54:41 PM):  yes
vincent (1:54:48 PM):  yeah.
mara (1:54:52 PM):  but ive been in NY for 10 years
george (1:54:56 PM):  ah ok...just making sure i remember correctly
mara (1:55:12 PM):  you do..! : P
george (1:55:28 PM):  have you heard of georges st pierre?
mara (1:55:45 PM):  yeah but never been there
rachael (1:56:01 PM):  What is it?
george (1:56:05 PM):  oh, didn't know of a place...i'm talking about the guy
george (1:56:16 PM):  he's an mma superstar from quebec
rachael (1:56:23 PM):  Ok.  Who is he
rachael (1:56:28 PM):  MMA?
vincent (1:56:32 PM):  MMA?
vincent (1:56:34 PM):  ha!
mara (1:56:41 PM):  haha well he has a statue after him and its like in this huge garden in
george (1:56:48 PM):  mixed martial arts, ultimate fighting championship
rachael (1:57:09 PM):  There's not really a statue?
vincent (1:57:24 PM):  that stuff kind of bums me out... like oldboy, but without good art design and writing.
george (1:58:00 PM):  i kinda got into watching it because i have a wrestling background
rachael (1:58:01 PM):  How can you be a fighter named georges st. pierre?? Sounds more like a poet?
mara (1:58:08 PM):  maybe not, but i know he has some kind of a tribute in his name
george (1:58:18 PM):  lol
vincent (1:58:35 PM):  totally, a warrior poet.
mara (1:58:40 PM):  wrestling in my family too
george (1:58:50 PM):  no you might be right, mara..that guy is a rags to riches story and super popular in quebec
mara (1:58:53 PM):  my dad and his twin brother were both NYState champs
rachael (1:58:56 PM):  We're wrestler-free.
george (1:59:16 PM):  lol "wrestler-free"
vincent (1:59:23 PM):  I used to like fake pro wrestling as a kid.  a lot.
george (1:59:30 PM):  i wrestled for 5 years in japan, freestyle
mara (1:59:31 PM):  yea, i dont know the story really but my father might for sure
rachael (1:59:41 PM):  mara, do they coach now?
mara (1:59:54 PM):  OMG vincent!  My brother used to have his friends over every weekend for that crap... lol
mara (2:00:01 PM):  my uncle coaches, ya
vincent (2:00:15 PM):  yeah, me too, we would get the stupid Pay Per View events and stuff!
george (2:00:51 PM):  pro wrestling was huge back in the day
rachael (2:01:03 PM):  My jet-li movies are so tame.
vincent (2:01:25 PM):  do real wresting people think that Pro Wrestling is giving wrestling a bad name?
vincent (2:01:37 PM):  or do mixed martial arts people think that?
mara (2:01:43 PM):  my uncle is here now and he just said some people he knows trained with st.pierre
george (2:01:43 PM):  eh...two separate things
george (2:02:01 PM):  pro wrestling is like a tv show
vincent (2:02:11 PM):  yeah, a soap opera
rachael (2:02:21 PM):  All staged?
george (2:02:26 PM):  nice nice...st pierre is the man!  :P
mara (2:02:44 PM):  vincent, i dont know my family watches pro wrestling and they bet on it and stuff... really popular i think no matter what
george (2:02:51 PM):  yea everything about pro wrestling is just over-exaggerated
mara (2:03:04 PM):  poor hulk hogan!
mara (2:03:06 PM):  hahah
vincent (2:03:27 PM):  I have a friend who lives in NY and he works for the pro wrestling magazine... he said that now with HDTV, the guys can't use spray-on tan, or airbrush their muscles anymore!
vincent (2:03:41 PM):  so funny!  they have to actually get in shape now!
george (2:03:46 PM):  lol
vincent (2:04:34 PM):  and there's like a secret room where the writers work out all the "plots"... and no one is allowed anywhere near it.
mara (2:04:36 PM):  yeah they get injured for real too from this stuff
vincent (2:04:49 PM):  so crazy.
mara (2:04:49 PM):  even if it is staged it takes a toll on their body like no other
george (2:05:40 PM):  yea they actually break bones and need real stiches
rachael (2:05:41 PM):  Do people make a living doing pro wrestling?
vincent (2:05:49 PM):  ow!
vincent (2:06:01 PM):  yeah!  Hulk Hogan is like a millionaire.
mara (2:06:01 PM):  yeah do you know Hulk Hogan?
mara (2:06:08 PM):  have you ever hear do fhim i shoudl say?
mara (2:06:22 PM):  he had a reality tv show and everything

mara (2:06:49 PM):  i felt so bad for him when he would go to the docs for cortizone shots in his back and shit he was really ill
rachael (2:06:50 PM):  OMG, I thought you were talking about the Incredible Hulk.  Hulk Hogan is a real person??
vincent (2:07:03 PM):  oh yeah, lots of those guys, go on to be famous bad actors.
george (2:07:06 PM):  actually jesse ventura also went on to become govna!
vincent (2:07:33 PM):  yeah, Hulk Hogan, not Bruce Banner/Incredible Hulk
rachael (2:07:33 PM):  It was the feather boa that did it.
vincent (2:08:20 PM):  Was just watching Predator with Jesse V and Arnold S., a friend said, "weird, 2 novelty governors in one movie!"
george (2:08:31 PM):  brooke hogan S2
mara (2:08:56 PM):  i cant get over that you dont know hulk hogan
mara (2:08:59 PM):  you have any sons?
rachael (2:08:59 PM):  I like "novelty governors."  Wish we had one.
rachael (2:09:19 PM):  I knew the name.  I just didn't know he was a real person!
mara (2:09:19 PM):  i understood the DC for Cutie thing..  but this rachael is too far haha
vincent (2:09:24 PM):  who is Gov of NY now?
vincent (2:09:29 PM):  I should still know.
rachael (2:09:41 PM):  I have two sons, so I have no excuse.
mara (2:09:55 PM):  patterson
vincent (2:10:04 PM):  oh yeah.
mara (2:10:08 PM):  yeah you should ask them about him, rachael, haha
rachael (2:10:25 PM):  I'll give it a shot.
george (2:10:28 PM):  oh that's right not spitzer
vincent (2:10:49 PM):  ask them if they've ever experienced Hulkamania!!!
mara (2:11:01 PM):  haha
rachael (2:11:04 PM):  No, nobody here ilkes wrestling, I'm told. No Hulkmania!
george (2:11:14 PM):  they gonna tear their shirts off
vincent (2:11:27 PM):  guess not.
rachael (2:11:49 PM):  But I did know David Patterson!
vincent (2:12:02 PM):  here's my last stab at "moderating" or whatever... real quick: What's the worst job you've ever had?
george (2:12:26 PM):  web design
rachael (2:12:51 PM):  I used to work for a cartoon character named Reddy Kilowatt.  I had to write about how you should use as much electricity as possible.
vincent (2:13:01 PM):  what???????????????????????????/
vincent (2:13:07 PM):  seriously?
rachael (2:13:08 PM):  True.
vincent (2:13:14 PM):  holy shit!
mara (2:13:27 PM):  telecommunications stuff where you do surveys over the phone!
mara (2:13:30 PM):  thats the worst
mara (2:13:51 PM):  no one ever wants to do one so you basically just place calls and get rejected all day long
rachael (2:13:53 PM):  That sounds awful.  I hope I haven't hung up on you ever.
vincent (2:14:04 PM):  people are mean to telemarketers
george (2:14:17 PM):  use as much electricity as possible?  is that like doing commercials using ad absurdum or whatever you call it?
vincent (2:14:22 PM):  it's the anonymity... you can be rude if people don't see you.  happens on the internet lots, too.
mara (2:14:22 PM):  lol, i didnt sell anything but i did the comm stuff to get answers for surveys
rachael (2:14:34 PM):  No, it was for real.
george (2:15:00 PM):  so you were trying to convince people to use as much electricity as possible?
vincent (2:15:05 PM):  Just found this:  On September 30, 2008, Stephen Colbert said on his show, The Colbert Report, that Las Vegas was "lit up and air conditioned 24/7 like Reddy Kilowatt's wet dream. Although it's probably not a good idea to get him wet."
george (2:15:05 PM):  lol
mara (2:15:15 PM):  yeah and some of the surveys were 45mins long depending on what answers you gave ya know
mara (2:15:22 PM):  so people got real annoyed!
rachael (2:15:30 PM):  Colbert has Reddy Kilowatt down.
vincent (2:15:49 PM):  crazy.
mara (2:15:56 PM):  funny!
rachael (2:16:04 PM):  How can you browse and do this?  I thought I would lose the conversation if I tried.
vincent (2:16:14 PM):  mine is a tie for different reasons: High School job at Taco Bell,  or Alaska fishing boat job.
mara (2:16:14 PM):  im going to las vegas in august... ill keep that in mind
mara (2:16:28 PM):  just open another window
rachael (2:16:36 PM):  Fishing boat, for sure.
vincent (2:17:05 PM):  it sucked, but there were cool things about it.  beautiful and new and exciting.  not boring.  but hard and crappy.
rachael (2:17:29 PM):  I know many perfectly nice people who go to las vegas becuase of the desert, which is beautiful.
vincent (2:17:50 PM):  Vegas is so surreal... it's like, "who thought of all of this?"
mara (2:17:53 PM):  im going for a bachelorette party!
mara (2:18:00 PM):  should be interesting to say the least
vincent (2:18:11 PM):  let's have a fake NY, and fake Paris, and... I don't know... bikini bull riding?  and Elvis?
vincent (2:18:22 PM):  that's going to be rowdy!
rachael (2:18:22 PM):  I don't think you'll get to see the desert!
mara (2:18:45 PM):  yeah i dont think so either haha.. and hopefully its rowdy
mara (2:18:58 PM):  so whos going to be here tomorrow?
george (2:19:03 PM):  is a bachelorette party anything like a bachelor party?
mara (2:19:04 PM):  i mean thrusday?
mara (2:19:05 PM):  lol
rachael (2:19:19 PM):  You remember the screen problem from yesterday?  I keep having "hello vincent" flashing up for a second, the back to normal again.
mara (2:19:24 PM):  well sometimes
rachael (2:19:55 PM):  Thursday is evening?  I think I am scheduled.
mara (2:19:55 PM):  yeah thats what it does sometimes when people press enter i think and we are getting a new message... its weird
mara (2:20:13 PM):  yeah 8:30-10 or something like that
mara (2:20:36 PM):  i might be here late if i sign on at all because i have class till 8:30 so maybe youll see me around 9
vincent (2:20:59 PM):  I'm not here Thursday.
vincent (2:21:12 PM):  Probably riding back up to Seattle that day.
rachael (2:21:22 PM):  I could be all by myself until 9?
vincent (2:21:31 PM):  solo chat.
vincent (2:21:42 PM):  soliloquy.
vincent (2:21:46 PM):  (sp)
george (2:21:50 PM):  split personality conversation
rachael (2:21:56 PM):  I could finish an assignment.
rachael (2:22:10 PM):  I like the sp conversation.
mara (2:22:16 PM):  no no no i think people are signed up for sure
george (2:22:25 PM):  you could create evil rachael to talk with good rachael
rachael (2:22:32 PM):  Maybe the moderator person will come out of hiding!
vincent (2:22:42 PM):  I'm looking, there are 4 other people.  but some of them haven't shown up yet at any of these.
mara (2:22:44 PM):  yeah maybe
mara (2:22:47 PM):  i doubt it
mara (2:23:00 PM):  and they were signed up vincent?
vincent (2:23:12 PM):  yeah, a few were signed up for these last few.
mara (2:23:19 PM):  they are dumb! its 10$ how could you not want to do this and help them out with their research
rachael (2:23:34 PM):  Maybe seeing who shows up is part of the study.
vincent (2:23:36 PM):  Ryan, shelly, Xiaojun
george (2:23:40 PM):  actually i probably will be here thursday
vincent (2:24:06 PM):  yeah, it's weird to skip out on this.

lynn (20:01:32 PM):  hi
meg (20:02:01 PM):  so what's your guys' choice for best city in Europe?
moderator (20:02:16 PM):  Great, so I see you guys have started already.
melany (20:02:25 PM):  i want to go to europe so badly, i'm mad i've never been :(
meg (20:02:29 PM):  Me neither!
moderator (20:02:32 PM):  You may continue. Just want to check if there's a leader.
melany (20:02:38 PM):  i'm looking forward to what others say about it
luke (20:02:39 PM):  haha me neither.....
moderator (20:02:42 PM):  lynn, would you mind being the leader today?
lynn (20:02:54 PM):  sure
moderator (20:03:01 PM):  Ok great, continue then!
meg (20:03:07 PM):  I have always wanted to go to Paris
melany (20:03:09 PM):  me too
meg (20:03:10 PM):  That's my top choice
melany (20:03:19 PM):  i want to be proposed to there (if that ever happens)
meg (20:03:19 PM):  I've been to London before but never Paris
melany (20:03:20 PM):  haha
lynn (20:03:26 PM):  paris is nice, but hard to get around if you don't speak french sometimes
meg (20:03:27 PM):  That would be lovely
melany (20:03:30 PM):  what was london like? ive been dying to go there
luke (20:03:34 PM):  how many of us have actually been to europe?
lynn (20:03:35 PM):  me too, melany
meg (20:03:35 PM):  Je parle le francais
meg (20:03:37 PM):  lol
meg (20:03:43 PM):  I've only been to the UK
meg (20:03:46 PM):  London was awesome
meg (20:03:53 PM):  I haven't been there since I was 10 though
lynn (20:03:53 PM):  london was really nice, too
meg (20:03:59 PM):  I have family there
melany (20:04:06 PM):  how was the weather in London?
meg (20:04:18 PM):  Honestly, kind of miserable
meg (20:04:21 PM):  hahaha
meg (20:04:27 PM):  It was cold and rainy in the middle of the summer
lynn (20:04:29 PM):  so for it seems paris and london are the top choices
meg (20:04:34 PM):  But the attractions are really cool
lynn (20:04:44 PM):  how about we choose some criteria for deciding, how does that sound to everyone?
melany (20:04:45 PM):  Thats what I have heard but people still say they loved it
meg (20:04:55 PM):  Like Harrods - this massive department store that is insanely cool!
meg (20:05:02 PM):  And the Tower of London
meg (20:05:11 PM):  You get to see where people were held and beheaded
meg (20:05:26 PM):  I was only there for 2 days so we did like the speedy sight seeing
meg (20:05:33 PM):  I'd stay longer if I was going back
melany (20:05:48 PM):  thats a good idea lynn
meg (20:06:08 PM):  The coolest thing that happened though- we were on one of those double decker bus tours and we saw Prince William!
lynn (20:06:10 PM):  price, weather, attractions, what are some other criteria
meg (20:06:13 PM):  Yeah, I agree lynn
luke (20:06:34 PM):  maybe the travel time>
lynn (20:06:39 PM):  language, i suppose, is importnat too
lynn (20:06:42 PM):  yes, i agree luke
meg (20:06:45 PM):  Yeah
lynn (20:06:46 PM):  to get there?
luke (20:06:57 PM):  i would think a big one would be exchange rates
meg (20:06:58 PM):  It takes 6 and 1/2 hours to get to the UK
luke (20:07:17 PM):  actually nevermind lol
luke (20:07:19 PM):  thats a bad one
lynn (20:07:32 PM):  pretty much i think it's the same for anywhere inn most of europe, right?
meg (20:07:38 PM):  Yeah
lynn (20:07:40 PM):  like, amsterdam is roughly 8 hours to travel to
luke (20:07:44 PM):  yeaa haha i realized it as soon as i hit enter and felt stupid
meg (20:07:58 PM):  But the good thing about Paris is that its the Euro which always seems to be a better exchange rate than the pound
melany (20:08:16 PM):  oh wow
lynn (20:08:18 PM):  the nice thing about the euro is that its good anywhere in europe
meg (20:08:22 PM):  Yeah
lynn (20:08:25 PM):  even budapest, prague
meg (20:08:31 PM):  You could travel out of the country
meg (20:08:35 PM):  Not in the UK hahaha
lynn (20:08:37 PM):  right
melany (20:08:50 PM):  how far is london from paris?
lynn (20:08:55 PM):  ok, so paris and london seem to be popular choices
lynn (20:09:02 PM):  i think about 3 hours by plane
meg (20:09:09 PM):  Or you could take a train
meg (20:09:14 PM):  Probably about the same
lynn (20:09:15 PM):  right, and take the chunnel
david (20:09:15 PM):  i would take a trian
meg (20:09:19 PM):  Me too
lynn (20:09:44 PM):  does anybody want to nominate cities other than paris or london?
meg (20:09:59 PM):  amsterdam
meg (20:10:03 PM):  I'd totally go there!
lynn (20:10:04 PM):  that's a good one
melany (20:10:19 PM):  i wanna go there
lynn (20:10:20 PM):  rome was absolutely cool, too
meg (20:10:20 PM):  One of my best friends went there and she said it was amazing
luke (20:10:27 PM):  I also heard florence is a great place as well
meg (20:10:30 PM):  And the language barrier isn't as big a problem
meg (20:10:45 PM):  OMG I would go to florence, my grandfather emigrated from there
luke (20:10:59 PM):  yeaa my friends studied abroad there and loved it
david (20:11:13 PM):  i went to florence to visit my friend who was studying abroad
david (20:11:17 PM):  it was pretty good
melany (20:11:22 PM):  i wonder how safe it is
meg (20:11:27 PM):  I know the architecture there is amazing
david (20:11:29 PM):  its really safe
lynn (20:11:34 PM):  i would also like to nominate prague
david (20:11:38 PM):  yeah, good architecture - yeah
david (20:11:49 PM):  oh , thats easy
david (20:11:53 PM):  its Amsterdam, Holland
david (20:12:13 PM):  it is the birth of tolerism - and has the most liberties
luke (20:12:13 PM):  well atleast we have a lot we can rank
lynn (20:12:15 PM):  is that your top choice, you mean, david?
meg (20:12:21 PM):  Yeah amsterdam seems really ciik
david (20:12:23 PM):  plus the highest quality of life
meg (20:12:23 PM):  '*cool
melany (20:12:38 PM):  yeaaa

lynn (20:12:58 PM):  hi macy
meg (20:12:59 PM):  And paris as the top choice

melany (20:14:54 PM):  are you studying aborad?
macy (20:14:54 PM):  I've always wanted to visit Greece- no specific city really

luke (20:19:29 PM):  hmmm amsterdam and florence
lynn (20:19:41 PM):  mine are paris and rome
david (20:19:48 PM):  i'd say Amsterdam and London , those are my top two - nothing real exotic, thats for sure - i wish i'd been to Oslo or Budapest or prague
melany (20:19:50 PM):  rome is supposed to be beautiful
david (20:20:05 PM):  and all these awesome cities, like stocholm, and copenhagen, but i havent
macy (20:20:10 PM):  i chose 2 that i've never been to before
david (20:20:11 PM):  Ive been to Rome, it is amazing
lynn (20:20:21 PM):  amsterdam seems to be a recurring city
meg (20:20:21 PM):  Its a tough choice
david (20:20:23 PM):  i went to the colliseum and the sistine chapel and the vatican
luke (20:20:28 PM):  ahah yea it does
melany (20:20:37 PM):  was rome fun?
lynn (20:20:42 PM):  rome was beautiful
macy (20:20:42 PM):  what a great opportunity, david
meg (20:20:45 PM):  I think amsterdam would be the number one then hahaha
david (20:20:49 PM):  yeah, it was a lot of fun - it was hard to sleep, i basically slept very little
melany (20:20:54 PM):  or just historical?
lynn (20:21:13 PM):  why are people picking amsterdam? just want to find out the reasons to narrow this down
meg (20:21:25 PM):  I have friends in Rome, it's supposed to be super fun
david (20:21:28 PM):  it is historical of course - but its pretty too - although not much green space or parks - and i took a train there, which was efficient - theyve had some problems with litter
lynn (20:21:32 PM):  most people like the party atmostpher in amsterdam
david (20:21:36 PM):  but rome is really good overall
meg (20:21:39 PM):  I'd choose Amsterdam because they have a lot of attractions
david (20:21:43 PM):  yeah, Amsterdam is the best
lynn (20:21:43 PM):  i thought rome was pretty cool when i was there
lynn (20:21:46 PM):  clean
lynn (20:21:49 PM):  and friendly
melany (20:21:55 PM):  what are the attractions like?
meg (20:22:08 PM):  link
david (20:22:19 PM):  i thought Florence was cleaner - the attractions ,. there are resteraunts and lots of cafes
melany (20:22:20 PM):  thanks meg!
meg (20:22:23 PM):  There's the cool i amsterdam place!
lynn (20:22:28 PM):  sorry, but can people say why they personally want to go to amsterdam, i think we need to narrow down some criteria
macy (20:22:34 PM):  well the rijks was beautiful but thats all i really remember. and the line of people waiting to visit anne frank's house. we didnt have time to do that
meg (20:22:38 PM):  There's a lot of ways to get around the city
david (20:22:44 PM):  yeah, plus the Heineken in Amsterdam is better and colder than in the U.S., way better
meg (20:22:46 PM):  the red light district would be cool
melany (20:22:46 PM):  i heard it hadthe best nightlight
luke (20:22:52 PM):  i heard its very laid back and the people are actually very friendy wherever u go
melany (20:22:57 PM):  but i still choose london and paris
david (20:23:05 PM):  yeah, plus the tulips are in bloom in the spring, and they're mind blowing
lynn (20:23:08 PM):  ok, ,so laid back party atmostphere, red light, drinking
lynn (20:23:12 PM):  tulips
meg (20:23:18 PM):  architecture
lynn (20:23:21 PM):  architecture
david (20:23:25 PM):  bicycles everywhere
melany (20:23:27 PM):  are there alot of tulips?
meg (20:23:30 PM):  they've got some awesome buildings
meg (20:23:31 PM):  hahaha
david (20:23:38 PM):  yeah, they are world famous for their tulips
meg (20:23:38 PM):  the canals
david (20:23:43 PM):  yeah, canals
lynn (20:23:46 PM):  right, the =canals
melany (20:23:52 PM):  interesting
meg (20:24:04 PM):  It looks really clean
lynn (20:24:10 PM):  that's pretty unique for eruope, something you don't see in all the cities, you see great architecture everywhere
meg (20:24:15 PM):  and its a very international city from what i've heard
lynn (20:24:16 PM):  but not canals
melany (20:24:28 PM):  which city do u guys think has the best archietcture?
meg (20:24:29 PM):  like people migrate there quite often
lynn (20:24:31 PM):  ok, so why would people want to go to london?
david (20:24:31 PM):  it is clean - very international - but the living spaces are small, its really expensive
meg (20:24:35 PM):  Florence
lynn (20:24:40 PM):  sorry, melany
lynn (20:24:42 PM):  i would say rome
meg (20:24:43 PM):  Or thens
david (20:24:58 PM):  london is the largest city, geographically - but like all these cities, its super expensive - thats of course the one thing that sucks about all big cities
meg (20:25:04 PM):  Yeah, david, but to visit and experience it
macy (20:25:09 PM):  rome or athens- due to history
meg (20:25:09 PM):  I would totally choose that
melany (20:25:10 PM):  ok so florence and rome have the best architecture?
david (20:25:16 PM):  yeah, its worth the money
meg (20:25:19 PM):  or athens
lynn (20:25:19 PM):  yes, i think thats what people are saying
melany (20:25:21 PM):  or athens*
lynn (20:25:22 PM):  or athens
lynn (20:25:40 PM):  would you all prefer architecture or more the party/night life when visiting?
meg (20:25:46 PM):  London was quite dirty from what I remember
melany (20:25:52 PM):  i would prefer the partt/night life
meg (20:25:56 PM):  I'd prefer the night life
david (20:25:56 PM):  Athens - well they have huge debt and strikes right now, my friend is from Thessaloniki, i visited him there and actually am still in good contact with him, and the headlines in the news are true - there are a lot of strikes
luke (20:25:58 PM):  party/night life just because of the age im at i suppose
luke (20:26:07 PM):  but i would enjoy the architecture as well
david (20:26:13 PM):  and debt problems, problems with unemployment, but hopefully Greece will rebound strong
melany (20:26:21 PM):  so athens sounds like a no i guess?
meg (20:26:22 PM):  That's awful
lynn (20:26:38 PM):  how many other people would pick athens as their top choice?
macy (20:27:01 PM):  i would
melany (20:27:26 PM):  i wouldnt
meg (20:27:27 PM):  top choice for architecture?
macy (20:27:31 PM):  yes
meg (20:27:34 PM):  yeah
meg (20:27:38 PM):  but not in general
luke (20:27:39 PM):  i suppose so
melany (20:27:40 PM):  cool
lynn (20:27:48 PM):  but would it be your top choice to visit in general, macy?
david (20:28:01 PM):  it does have really good architeture, especially historically speaking - they were leaders in that of course - but i'd say amsterdam and london
macy (20:28:07 PM):  yes, i guess i appreciate the history the most and what it gave us
melany (20:28:20 PM):  ok so macy athens is ur number one?
david (20:28:20 PM):  unfortunately, i can only speak form my experience, which is limited -
lynn (20:28:24 PM):  ok, so athens has one vote as top destination
macy (20:28:25 PM):  the buildings are symbolic of that
lynn (20:28:40 PM):  sounds like amsterdame has a few more votes as top
lynn (20:28:42 PM):  destination
luke (20:28:45 PM):  yea'
meg (20:28:50 PM):  yeah
david (20:28:50 PM):  yeah, thats my vote
luke (20:29:01 PM):  yup
lynn (20:29:02 PM):  how about london? is that anybody's absolute top choice?
meg (20:29:05 PM):  the more I look at it the more I want to go
meg (20:29:10 PM):  I wouldn't choose it
meg (20:29:16 PM):  Its a great city
david (20:29:16 PM):  london could be my second choice
macy (20:29:21 PM):  it would be 2nd to athens for me (if that matters for the ranking)
meg (20:29:25 PM):  buuuut, its dirty and cold
lynn (20:29:32 PM):  right, the ranking
lynn (20:29:35 PM):  good call
melany (20:29:36 PM):  london is my second choise
melany (20:29:45 PM):  i wish the weather was better
david (20:29:47 PM):  london can be cold, but its def. no colder than albany, thats for sure - maybe more rain though
melany (20:29:51 PM):  ugh
luke (20:29:55 PM):  sounds terrible haha
melany (20:29:56 PM):  sounds terrible haha
lynn (20:29:59 PM):  sounds like amsterdam is definitely the top choice, is everybody in agreement on that?
meg (20:30:00 PM):  I know, its miserable during the summer though
melany (20:30:00 PM):  wow weird
melany (20:30:01 PM):  haha
meg (20:30:07 PM):  yes
luke (20:30:10 PM):  lol yeaa thats crazy
macy (20:30:11 PM):  yea
melany (20:30:23 PM):  london is miserable in the summer?
david (20:30:27 PM):  yeah, but seattle and vancouve have a lot of rain for example, and they are great cities
lynn (20:30:32 PM):  i thought it was just too rainy
david (20:30:33 PM):  no, its great in the summer
david (20:30:37 PM):  its similar to NYC

lynn (20:30:51 PM):  i personally don't like that much rain
david (20:30:54 PM):  haha, that sucks
melany (20:31:01 PM):  ugh sounds terrivle
melany (20:31:03 PM):  terrible*
melany (20:31:08 PM):  i wonder when the best time to go is
lynn (20:31:09 PM):  it depresses me and would cause me not to go there again
luke (20:31:09 PM):  yea it does
david (20:31:10 PM):  but it could rain that much in NYC too - it depends on your luck
meg (20:31:16 PM):  ikts true
meg (20:31:29 PM):  but I'd want to enjoy my vacation
lynn (20:31:32 PM):  right, but i've never experienced that in NYC, five straight days
macy (20:31:32 PM):  poor england has such a bad rap ; )
meg (20:31:36 PM):  and not get stuck in a constant downpour
melany (20:31:38 PM):  yeah seriously

lynn (20:34:45 PM):  different kind of partying, i suppose
macy (20:34:46 PM):  david, i just threw in my comment about that country and its big city- it might have confused some

lynn (20:34:59 PM):  paris
david (20:35:04 PM):  oh , i see

luke (20:35:19 PM):  hmm ill have to look it up
macy (20:35:32 PM):  bosnia was part of the old yugoslavia
david (20:35:35 PM):  yeah, the thing about Paris it seems - is that its even more stratified than other big cities - so its very classist, but this is a stereotype of course, and not actually based on any direct experience
macy (20:35:42 PM):  its now bosnia, croatia, and serbia
melany (20:35:43 PM):  paris seems so romantic ;)
meg (20:35:51 PM):  i agree melany

meg (20:36:44 PM):  Paris has better weather by far
macy (20:36:52 PM):  i dont know any of these french names/landmarks oops

david (20:37:59 PM):  although thats debateable i guess
luke (20:38:02 PM):  im going to have to do some studying of these countries lol im not as knowledgeable

david (20:39:14 PM):  no, swedes are blonde and blue eyed, not much tan
melany (20:39:15 PM):  lucky them haha

luke (20:39:27 PM):  sounds like a nice place
melany (20:39:29 PM):  i know a norwegian girl and she is gorgeous
meg (20:39:29 PM):  my room mate over the summer was danish
meg (20:39:37 PM):  and she was absolutely astonishing
david (20:39:45 PM):  they get burned in the sun, like Irish - but Greek women and Israeli women are different features , dark eye and hair, same with men from those countries, and that is just as cool
melany (20:39:46 PM):  blonde blue eyed and tan (could be cuz of fake tanning tho)
meg (20:39:48 PM):  tall and thin and blonde and blue eyed
lynn (20:39:52 PM):  i had a finnish roommate when i was overseas and people literally stopped to starre at her
melany (20:40:00 PM):  hahah theyre so lucky!!!
david (20:40:07 PM):  wow, Finland, that is awesome - they are good at hockey too
lynn (20:40:09 PM):  one guy even took her picture at an airport

lynn (20:41:53 PM):  geneva?
david (20:41:59 PM):  yeah, they are huge on banks and privacy
david (20:42:09 PM):  lots of billionaire bankers, and the Swiss are notorious
melany (20:42:18 PM):  i was reading today that their movie tickets were more expensive
lynn (20:42:21 PM):  rich, but maybe not a nation of partyers
melany (20:42:22 PM):  thats all i know
david (20:42:26 PM):  for non-committing and remainign neutral, they dont take a position , thats the criticism of their stereotype
meg (20:42:29 PM):  I haven't heard but switzerland is awesome for skiing

macy (20:43:53 PM):  so do we have a new ranking now that we've mentioned so many new places?
lynn (20:43:59 PM):  so far, seems amsterdam is the top choice, with maybe londong or athens second, paris third?
david (20:44:17 PM):  yeah, part of Switzerland speaks French - but what about the other part, is there another language
macy (20:44:17 PM):  i liked the idea of paris also
lynn (20:44:18 PM):  or am i way off?
meg (20:44:22 PM):  german
lynn (20:44:23 PM):  german
lynn (20:44:31 PM):  maybe paris should be second, then

lynn (20:55:20 PM):  which one, though?
melany (20:55:23 PM):  so everyone would want to go to amseetrdam most ikely?
melany (20:55:25 PM):  likely*
macy (20:55:27 PM):  rome?
melany (20:55:30 PM):  is that what we've decided?
lynn (20:55:37 PM):  i think so, mewlany
meg (20:55:38 PM):  i think rome first... and yes to melany
lynn (20:55:39 PM):  melany, sorry
david (20:55:57 PM):  yeah, amsterdam is best
melany (20:56:20 PM):  too bad we didnt win a free trip there tonight :)
melany (20:56:21 PM):  hahaha
lynn (20:56:32 PM):  i know, right??!!
melany (20:56:41 PM):  that would be great compensation
macy (20:56:42 PM):  watch out for the bikers in amsterdame- they rule the sidewalks with their bells
meg (20:56:59 PM):  i know! I'd be happy for sure
meg (20:57:20 PM):  go to europe instead of midterm tomorrow
meg (20:57:22 PM):  heck yes!
melany (20:57:22 PM):  hahaha macy
melany (20:57:24 PM):  thats funny
lynn (20:57:35 PM):  anybody have a strong preference for rome or florence over the other?
lynn (20:57:41 PM):  one's a bigger city
macy (20:57:42 PM):  its true- i was yelled at and everything and i was only 15 yrs old! lol
macy (20:57:52 PM):  i'd go with Rome
melany (20:57:52 PM):  ive got no preference
david (20:57:56 PM):  well, i dont want to make things difficult - yet i liked florence better, although i was only
luke (20:58:11 PM):  i think id pick florence as well
david (20:58:13 PM):  in each for about 5 days each, so i dont even know if thats enough to form a strong preference, but florence was cooler i thought
luke (20:58:25 PM):  just because ive heard more about it
meg (20:58:25 PM):  i'm game for either
macy (20:58:30 PM):  ii was never in either one so i can sway to a different city : )
lynn (20:58:48 PM):  i kind of think i'd go for florence too, just because i think it's more full of character
lynn (20:58:54 PM):  and more laid back
lynn (20:59:04 PM):  but i don't hve a strong preference
melany (20:59:08 PM):  hmmmm
macy (20:59:23 PM):  sounds like florence got the ranking
david (20:59:29 PM):  yeah, its smaller for sure - but older feeling, i dont know how thats possible, but its older, more pedestrian
melany (20:59:57 PM):  sounds good
lynn (21:00:03 PM):  sounds good to me
macy (21:00:07 PM):  sure
meg (21:00:08 PM):  probably just inhabited continuously for longer
lynn (21:01:06 PM):  very cool
meg (21:01:11 PM):  like, its not as ruined as rome is
meg (21:01:14 PM):  if that makes sense
melany (21:01:16 PM):  yea
luke (21:01:32 PM):  yupp
lynn (21:01:55 PM):  it's hard to believe how old some of these cities are
meg (21:02:00 PM):  i know!
melany (21:02:03 PM):  crazy!
melany (21:02:20 PM):  so much culture
david (21:02:28 PM):  yeah, real old - lots of ruins in greece too
macy (21:02:42 PM):  we just dont know what old means here in usa
melany (21:02:48 PM):  david, what did u think of the beaches in greece?
david (21:03:04 PM):  talcum powder sand, blue - clear water
lynn (21:03:06 PM):  i saw the mount vesuvius volcano in greece, where lot sof people died, and it was so amazing to see that

lynn (21:03:17 PM):  cool about the beaches
david (21:03:21 PM):  a lot of british tourists
david (21:03:31 PM):  extremely warm water
meg (21:03:33 PM):  the brits are obsessed with greece lol
macy (21:03:35 PM):  how close were you lynn?
melany (21:03:54 PM):  sounds so good
david (21:04:02 PM):  Rhodes is amazing, its the largest of the Greek islands and runs 24/7 in the summer
lynn (21:04:08 PM):  right next to it. the town next to it was destroyed, but some people got caught and you could see the shapes of their bodies (which had long ago decomposed)
macy (21:04:18 PM):  oh wow
lynn (21:04:36 PM):  it was kind of gory, but amazing to think about it happening and what they went through
macy (21:04:47 PM):  absolutely and that you were right there seeing it
meg (21:05:03 PM):  i'd kill to see it
melany (21:05:09 PM):  me too
luke (21:05:34 PM):  sounds very interesting
macy (21:05:43 PM):  i had a wonderful visit to heidelberg in germany
david (21:05:46 PM):  sounds pretty gory though, if there are dead bodies
lynn (21:05:48 PM):  what did you see?
macy (21:06:11 PM):  beautiful city on a hill- city built within walls
lynn (21:06:13 PM):  yea, it was kind of, but you didn't see any bodies, just where the bodies were. The volcanic ash stuck in that formation
lynn (21:06:18 PM):  very cool, macy
meg (21:06:33 PM):  yeah, awesome
meg (21:06:34 PM):  :)

mara (11:26:09 AM):  hi shelly
mara (11:26:23 AM):  hows it goin?
shelly (11:26:42 AM):  Pretty good. Any idea who's leading the discussion today or what the topic is?
mara (11:27:06 AM):  nope! i dont even know who is suppose to be here
mara (11:27:07 AM):  ha
shelly (11:27:44 AM):  Got it. How did your discussion lead go?
mara (11:27:55 AM):  it was fine
mara (11:28:09 AM):  there were only three people here, including me! so it wasnt too hard
shelly (11:28:10 AM):  What did you talk about?
shelly (11:28:17 AM):  Hey vincent.
mara (11:28:21 AM):  pop culture and movies and stuff
vincent (11:28:22 AM):  good morning
shelly (11:28:30 AM):  Cool.
shelly (11:28:42 AM):  You running the show today vincent?
vincent (11:28:57 AM):  not that I know of.
mara (11:28:59 AM):  morning!
shelly (11:29:11 AM):  LOL. But you could be wrong, eh?
vincent (11:29:36 AM):  could be, but I didn't get any email about it.  I am confused, though, it's only 8:30am out here.
shelly (11:29:49 AM):  Wow, crack o'
shelly (11:29:53 AM):  dawn.
vincent (11:30:25 AM):  but I'm back home in seattle, so the internet works in my bed!
mara (11:30:38 AM):  thats amazing
mara (11:30:58 AM):  i have to use one the school computers cuz this program doesnt work on the MAC computer that I have
vincent (11:31:08 AM):  ouch.
mara (11:31:33 AM):  yeah but it was pretty nice of them to loan me a laptop! ha
vincent (11:31:45 AM):  that's very cool.
mara (11:31:49 AM):  hi ariel... you leading?
vincent (11:32:04 AM):  hey ariel.
vincent (11:33:06 AM):  hm, so no one asked any of us?
vincent (11:33:23 AM):  there's always more people signed up than actually show up.
mara (11:33:28 AM):  nope maybe its time that someone just poses a topic
mara (11:33:49 AM):  yeah and i have to leave early i have a meeting at 1pm
vincent (11:34:08 AM):  ah.
vincent (11:34:33 AM):  do you guys have an Albany Craigslist?
mara (11:34:47 AM):  yes sir! love it!
vincent (11:35:21 AM):  awesome.  I just took a trip from Seattle to Oakland to visit my girlfriend... I used the rideshare, and got down there and back (14 hour drive), for $20!!
mara (11:36:52 AM):  wow thats nice
mara (11:37:05 AM):  im going to NC soon, remember? and I think its like a 12 hour drive
vincent (11:37:20 AM):  super lucky.  I've used it a bunch before, but this was the luckiest one.
vincent (11:37:26 AM):  yeah, are you driving to NC?
mara (11:37:41 AM):  yup
vincent (11:38:25 AM):  you should try to find some riders on there, it would make gas super cheap, and it makes the drive pretty interesting.
mara (11:39:11 AM):  well i have one girl coming with me and im afraid since we are staying for a week there may no be a lot of room haha
vincent (11:39:30 AM):  that makes sense.
mara (11:39:49 AM):  theres this website where they predict your gas prices and i used it and they said around $60 to get there
vincent (11:40:14 AM):  that's not too crazy.
vincent (11:40:50 AM):  my trip down ended up being free, the guy just wanted company.  it was with a Christian video game programmer, and a juggler from the circus.
mara (11:40:56 AM):  not if we split it i guess
mara (11:41:44 AM):  OMG that must have been interesting! haha
vincent (11:42:31 AM):  yeah!  then the trip back up was with a spanish teacher, a piano player, an architect, and a couple anarchist hitchhiker girls.
mara (11:42:49 AM):  what type of things did you talk about
vincent (11:43:21 AM):  all types of stuff.  the hottest topic seems to be "what other Craigslist rides have you taken?"
vincent (11:43:41 AM):  and "what are the weirdest people you've ever ridden with?"
mara (11:43:48 AM):  oh man, have you ever done it before?
vincent (11:44:01 AM):  yeah, I've done it a pretty good amoung of times.
vincent (11:44:24 AM):  where did shelly and ariel go?
mara (11:44:33 AM):  what happens with music on those trips?!
mara (11:44:39 AM):  no idea... lol
vincent (11:45:55 AM):  It's funny, people always seem hesitant to play music for a car full of strangers.  But then after a long time, the conversation dies down a little and someone puts something on.
vincent (11:46:48 AM):  there's this weird thing where everyone is like, "yeah, I'm up for listening to anything at all" but then no one volunteers anything.
mara (11:47:02 AM):  did you guys have same music preferences
mara (11:48:11 AM):  this is kinda boring with two people huh?
vincent (11:48:30 AM):  I have pretty broad music love, so I really can roll with (almost) everything.  The Spanish teacher dude played some pretty cheesy musical-theater sounding jazz.
vincent (11:48:33 AM):  Yeah!
vincent (11:48:40 AM):  it's weird in here.
mara (11:48:45 AM):  they should regulate this crap more... people need to show up!!
vincent (11:48:47 AM):  shelly??
vincent (11:49:39 AM):  wait, you have to go at what time?
mara (11:49:49 AM):  thats soooo funny!
vincent (11:50:18 AM):  what's funny?
mara (11:50:21 AM):  like 1240 or so...
mara (11:50:31 AM):  the spanish teachers cheesy music
vincent (11:50:40 AM):  whoa, I'm going to be in monologue mode for a little bit.
mara (11:51:05 AM):  yeah i guess so
vincent (11:51:16 AM):  yeah, that was a little questionable, but it didn't ruin the trip or anything.
mara (11:51:18 AM):  do your chate room users keep going blank?
vincent (11:51:40 AM):  No, it still shows shelly and ariel as signed in.
mara (11:52:21 AM):  mine has no one at all
vincent (11:52:30 AM):  she says we should sign out and then restart the server.
vincent (11:53:07 AM):  I mean just sign back in.
mara (11:54:53 AM):  so what should we talk about?
mara (11:55:10 AM):  what kind of beer your drink?
vincent (11:55:34 AM):  hello?
mara (11:55:50 AM):  ok leave! and comeback
vincent (11:56:37 AM):  hi!
vincent (11:56:41 AM):  again.
vincent (11:56:56 AM):  it looksl ike I'm the only one signed up
mara (11:57:04 AM):  no lol just once
vincent (11:57:17 AM):  I'm back.
mara (11:57:25 AM):  this is weird... errors in the chat i guess
mara (11:57:38 AM):  yay... ariel? are you with us?
ariel (11:57:52 AM):  Yes, I think so FINALLY
ariel (11:58:00 AM):  so what are we discussing
ariel (11:58:09 AM):  sorry, having mucho computer problems
mara (11:58:12 AM):  we are discussing how boring this was without you haha
vincent (11:58:18 AM):  we were discussing how it was weird that you guys disappeared.
vincent (11:58:23 AM):  ha
mara (11:58:26 AM):  haha vincent!
ariel (11:58:26 AM):  Well thanks :)
mara (11:58:39 AM):  what would you like to talk about?
mara (11:59:19 AM):  lets talk about food.. im starving!
ariel (11:59:27 AM):  I don't know
shelly (11:59:28 AM):  Woot. It works now.
mara (11:59:32 AM):  what do people like to eat?
ariel (11:59:46 AM):  pizza
vincent (11:59:48 AM):  nice.
mara (11:59:51 AM):  yay shelly! very ahppy you are with us
mara (11:59:55 AM):  pizza? what kinds?
mara (12:00:00 PM):  fav. toppings?
shelly (12:00:05 PM):  I used the time I couldn't log on to warm up some pasta, bacon, broc, and cheese sauce. That was yummy.
shelly (12:00:16 PM):  Wish I had more.
mara (12:00:29 PM):  left overs?
ariel (12:00:31 PM):  cheese, i am a vegetarian so i dont eat meat and i am not a huge fan of veggies on my pizza
vincent (12:00:42 PM):  I'm veggie too!
mara (12:00:50 PM):  yeah i get that... i love tofu
ariel (12:00:53 PM):  Nice
shelly (12:00:53 PM):  Pizza: broc, olives, sausage, onions
vincent (12:01:02 PM):  how long?
shelly (12:01:07 PM):  Tofu isn't a food. It's a texture in search of a flavor.
vincent (12:01:16 PM):  I mean, how long have you been vegetarian?
ariel (12:01:19 PM):  i do eat vegetables just not on my pizza, I have been a veggie for about twelve years now
mara (12:01:24 PM):  eww i like chicken bacon ranch with no pizza sauce haha
ariel (12:01:26 PM):  wow, just realizing this
vincent (12:01:34 PM):  me too about 12 years.
vincent (12:01:42 PM):  13, I guess.
ariel (12:01:51 PM):  oh wow, funny
vincent (12:01:52 PM):  no pizza sauce, mara?
ariel (12:02:01 PM):  i've been since summer after senior year of college
ariel (12:02:08 PM):  or i mean high school
shelly (12:02:11 PM):  Given what I know about how meat is prepared in this country, I wish I could be a vegetarian. But I really crave meat. Specially bacon.
mara (12:02:23 PM):  no i hate tomato sauce... really weird i cant do it but i will eat tomatos just like apples
vincent (12:02:46 PM):  wow!  so in general you're not down with Italian food?
mara (12:03:01 PM):  yeah my boyfriend and his family have a farm so i get all the meat in the world! couldnt stop myself from eatting it haha
shelly (12:03:03 PM):  My wife adores tomato sauce. If I stopped eating, I'm sure she would leave me. "I just don't know you anymore." <gin>
ariel (12:03:15 PM):  I LOVE TOMATO SAUCE
mara (12:03:16 PM):  i like some of it, but it needs to be prepared plain hha
ariel (12:03:19 PM):  but hate tomatoes
vincent (12:03:26 PM):  me too.
shelly (12:03:38 PM):  That's the way to go. Know where your meat comes from. I should probably look into local farms and meat production.
vincent (12:03:49 PM):  3 favorite types of food (not in order): Thai, Italian, Mexican
mara (12:03:54 PM):  do you guys eat fish?
ariel (12:04:03 PM):  yes, you can always buy local at farmer's markets
ariel (12:04:12 PM):  then you can talk to the dude who prepares your meat
ariel (12:04:17 PM):  no fish either
shelly (12:04:22 PM):  I go with: Sushi, Pasta, Bacon
mara (12:04:23 PM):  yes you should shelly... local is the way to go!
vincent (12:04:24 PM):  I don't eat fish, but I ate fish the summer that I worked on a fishing boat.
ariel (12:04:47 PM):  italian, italian and italian?
ariel (12:04:49 PM):  hahaha
vincent (12:04:51 PM):  nice.
mara (12:04:53 PM):  you talked about that before... so strictly no meat at all!?
mara (12:05:09 PM):  mexican, chinese, tuna!
mara (12:05:10 PM):  haha
shelly (12:05:16 PM):  We eat fish regularly, and not just as sushi. My son will eat it and there's not that much he likes. Stupid picky teenagers. <gin>
mara (12:05:20 PM):  what about eggs?
vincent (12:05:22 PM):  no meat at all, except fake meat sometimes.
ariel (12:05:26 PM):  well yes, absolutely no mean for me at all but i do eat and drink dairy
ariel (12:05:35 PM):  yes eggs
ariel (12:05:40 PM):  i like to bake too much
mara (12:05:45 PM):  veggie burgers?
vincent (12:05:46 PM):  I do eat eggs, but mostly as ingredients in other things.  like bannana bread.
ariel (12:05:50 PM):  oh yeah i eat fake meat too
ariel (12:05:53 PM):  yeah veggie burgers
mara (12:06:09 PM):  i like veggie burgers!
ariel (12:06:14 PM):  i try to get free range eggs though
shelly (12:06:30 PM):  I used to eat eggs when I was young, but I don't have a taste for them anymore. Except as part of an omlet or mixed with liberal doses of cheese. Then again, anything with liberal doses of cheese works for me.
vincent (12:06:32 PM):  egg production, and lots of how dairy is made, is pretty dark.  but I haven't been able to stop.
vincent (12:06:51 PM):  cheese is one of my favorite things.
ariel (12:07:14 PM):  i do my best to choose the best products out there, what i can afford
mara (12:07:16 PM):  well my bfs fam has a dairy farm
vincent (12:07:20 PM):  that's where the Italian and Mexican score high.
shelly (12:07:23 PM):  I tried veggie burgers, but my expectation to taste real burger got in the way. If I eat veggie, which I do now and again, I don't want anything that's meat posing.
ariel (12:07:24 PM):  when i am working again i will probably do even better
vincent (12:07:51 PM):  no fake hot dogs, shelly?
mara (12:07:58 PM):  i guess i compare it to hollywood taking advantage of us and our interests to make money...farming takes advantage of cows and what they can produce to make money but at the same time feeding the whole world!
ariel (12:08:00 PM):  hahahaha, my family thinks i am crazy for eating meat substitutes, they say my tastes buds are scewed
shelly (12:08:05 PM):  True, true about eggs. Or poultry for that matter. Pretty gruesome all in all.
mara (12:08:31 PM):  yes  chicken is another story, i do agree
vincent (12:08:38 PM):  not the whole world... mostly the First World.
shelly (12:09:04 PM):  A fake hot dog is easier to handle. The spices in hot dogs are so strong that the meat taste isn't always so noticable even in a real one. Besides with relish, catsup, and saurkraut, who knows there's a dog in there. ;)
ariel (12:09:11 PM):  i suppose you could talk yourself out of eating anything really
mara (12:09:28 PM):  ohman do you watch fear factor?
vincent (12:09:32 PM):  yeah, and no matter how gross the idea of "fake" is, the reality of a real hot dog is so gross!
shelly (12:09:36 PM):  Nope.
mara (12:09:42 PM):  they have to eat the nastiest stuff on that show!
ariel (12:09:44 PM):  in Toronto, they sell veggie dogs at hot dog stands on the side of the street, it is the craziest thing
shelly (12:10:05 PM):  Yah, "real" hot dogs are not something you want to think about too much.
ariel (12:10:07 PM):  they are a lot more vegetarian friendly around those parts
mara (12:10:09 PM):  gotta love CANADA!
ariel (12:10:11 PM):  just visited there
vincent (12:10:13 PM):  we have veggie dog vendors in Seattle.
shelly (12:10:24 PM):  Probably less meat to go around. We are spoiled in teh States.
mara (12:10:37 PM):  shelly you should check out fear factor sometime... soooooo funnt what people so or money
ariel (12:10:42 PM):  Yeah east coasters think that vegetarians are weird, hahahaha unless you live in maine
vincent (12:10:54 PM):  ariel, you just visited Seattle?
ariel (12:11:06 PM):  no Toronto
vincent (12:11:06 PM):  Ithaca, NY is veggie paradise.  pretty close to you guys.
mara (12:11:11 PM):  eting bull testicles! and stuff!  GROSS
vincent (12:11:20 PM):  ahhhhhhhhhh!
shelly (12:11:25 PM):  I actually watch a bunch of TV. I like scripted stuff though. Seeing how low people will go just feeds into my cynical side. I'm cynical enough in my old age.
mara (12:11:28 PM):  hahaha
ariel (12:11:32 PM):  fear factor freaks me out
mara (12:11:50 PM):  yeah me too! i would have a heart attack doing those things
ariel (12:11:53 PM):  i have always meant to visit Ithaca, i hear it is a pretty cool town
vincent (12:12:10 PM):  yeah, I lived there for a long time.  go in the summer: swimming in waterfalls!
shelly (12:12:13 PM):  It's gorge-ous. Sorry, had to do it.
vincent (12:12:21 PM):  ha.
vincent (12:12:44 PM):  and Ithaca has its own currency.
shelly (12:12:54 PM):  Huh?
mara (12:12:57 PM):  and they know how to drink!
ariel (12:13:20 PM):  hahahaha gorge-ous hahahaha
vincent (12:13:35 PM):  they have local money that's not backed by the federal gov't.  it pays at a better rate, and you can use it at all the local businesses.
ariel (12:13:39 PM):  maybe this summer
vincent (12:13:40 PM):  it's called Ithaca Hours.
ariel (12:13:55 PM):  i have decided recently to stop putting off stuff i want to do, but rather just do it
shelly (12:14:00 PM):  Who created this money? Is it backed by a local bank or something?
vincent (12:14:27 PM):  It's backed by some kind of local money, I don't remember the exact details, but it's pretty interesting and cool.
mara (12:14:27 PM):  lol
vincent (12:14:45 PM):  If you work in town, you can choose to get paid in a split of US$ and Ithaca Hours.
ariel (12:14:53 PM):  interesting i have never heard of this
ariel (12:15:13 PM):  how recent is this
shelly (12:15:22 PM):  We looked at Ithaca several years back because they have a community-supported farm complex and development that's seriously green. Very cool stuff.
ariel (12:15:28 PM):  i had a friend who went to Cornell and he never mentioned
mara (12:15:58 PM):  my bf with the farm studied at cornell university
mara (12:16:08 PM):  very prestigious thats for sure
vincent (12:16:18 PM):  it's existed since the 80s, I think.  and it's based on a living wage, like one hour of work = one "Hour", which I think is like $10.
ariel (12:16:24 PM):  yeah he went for veterinarian medicine
ariel (12:16:31 PM):  now he is a animal pathologist
mara (12:16:52 PM):  thats amazing really
shelly (12:16:57 PM):  They treat their own water and sewage via a swamp and do heavy recycle/reuse stuff. You buy into the community like a condo and join the political strucuture and everything. A bit too hippy for us, but the core principals are pretty attractive.
ariel (12:17:02 PM):  well now i really have to go and check this place out
vincent (12:17:30 PM):  found this: link
ariel (12:17:36 PM):  well as long as you are allowed to leave...
ariel (12:17:38 PM):  :)
mara (12:17:52 PM):  do you guys have pets?
shelly (12:18:01 PM):  I guess if don't refuse to take $, having an alternative currency wouldn't be illegal. Interesting if there's been any legal challenges or if the feds are unhappy about it.
vincent (12:18:16 PM):  not sure, I wonder.
vincent (12:18:26 PM):  I have a dog and a cat living at my house, but neither of them are "mine"
ariel (12:18:34 PM):  hhhhmmm be interesting to investigate
ariel (12:18:41 PM):  i have two cats
ariel (12:18:45 PM):  and a bunch of fish
mara (12:18:48 PM):  haha funn
shelly (12:19:03 PM):  My family wants a cat but I'm allergic. It's a black mark against me for sure. ;)
mara (12:19:08 PM):  i have a 125lb dog and a little rescue dog about 40 lbs
vincent (12:19:19 PM):  The dog is a black pug named Bugbear, the cat is called Professor Enchiladas.
mara (12:19:23 PM):  im allergic to cats too! and they scare the shit out of me
shelly (12:19:23 PM):  That's a big dog.
vincent (12:19:28 PM):  what are your pet names?
ariel (12:19:37 PM):  they scare you?
vincent (12:19:40 PM):  scared of cats?
mara (12:19:50 PM):  i have Keller the big one and Jesse the smalll on
ariel (12:19:54 PM):  Chloe and Otis, i don't name my fish because i find they die when you do
mara (12:20:04 PM):  yes very scared ive been attacked before by my neighbors cata
shelly (12:20:14 PM):  lol, so what's a person called who's scared of cats, a scaredy cat of cats?
mara (12:20:16 PM):  and they are soooo sneaky the way they walk and look at you
vincent (12:20:21 PM):  ha.
mara (12:20:27 PM):  i just cant do it!
ariel (12:20:36 PM):  cats can be nasty,  Otis is a freak
ariel (12:20:47 PM):  i don't like her, but she is actually my sister's cat so that is ok
vincent (12:20:48 PM):  yeah, it's definitely a different way of "communicating" then dogs.
vincent (12:20:54 PM):  it's subtle.
ariel (12:21:22 PM):  Chloe is a rescue cat and she seems to understand this, the most lovable cat ever
vincent (12:21:32 PM):  I grew up with dogs as a kid, so cats are pretty new, but my girlfriend has 3, so I'm learning.  I'm getting pretty good at reading them.
mara (12:21:33 PM):  yeah and my friend was like cats  just dont ever attack just to attack haha and then she went up to my friends cat sitting on the fireplace and it swatted at her and made her bleed
mara (12:21:39 PM):  i laughed in her face sooo hard lol
shelly (12:21:49 PM):  I always remember a comic I read where a guy walks past a cat and says, as an aside, "don't worry, I won't reveal your overlords plan to rule the universe." The next panel shows the cat saying "whew." It had nothing to do with the story, it was just a quick aside.
vincent (12:22:01 PM):  ha
ariel (12:22:16 PM):  hahahaha
ariel (12:22:33 PM):  here's a question, has any one ever heard of a band named Enter the Haggis
shelly (12:22:45 PM):  Definitely. Great irish rock.
vincent (12:22:54 PM):  watch out for twitching cat tail.  that usuall means, I'm annoyed and want to be left alone.
ariel (12:23:07 PM):  Nice, you know them
vincent (12:23:12 PM):  never heard them.
ariel (12:23:13 PM):  where are you from shelly
ariel (12:23:32 PM):  you should totally check them out : enterthehaggis.com
vincent (12:23:42 PM):  cool, I will.
ariel (12:23:46 PM):  they are more then just Irish rock, and they just came out with a new cd
vincent (12:24:03 PM):  I always think of the Pogues when I think of Irish rock.
mara (12:24:07 PM):  nope never heard
shelly (12:24:17 PM):  Celtic Cross, Atlan, Gaelic Storm, Killadares are similar and great as well.
ariel (12:24:19 PM):  the cool thing about their site is that you can listen to all their music for free
shelly (12:24:24 PM):  Pogues too, yep.
mara (12:24:55 PM):  that is cool
ariel (12:24:56 PM):  yes, they can be pogueish and a bit like Kildares
ariel (12:25:10 PM):  they are a bit less traditional then some celtic rock bands
shelly (12:25:13 PM):  I grew up in NJ but have lived in Albany for decades. Got into Irish/Scotish/Gaelic music a while back. We have an Irish festival here every year and I go and pick up five or six CDs of the various bands.
vincent (12:25:15 PM):  I guess the Pogues are like the entry-level Irish punk band... the one everyone has heard of.
ariel (12:25:22 PM):  they have changed, i dont' know if that is necessarily a good thing or not
shelly (12:25:36 PM):  I think the Pogues are the hardest rock of the bunch.
ariel (12:25:40 PM):  oh yeah, I2K
ariel (12:25:48 PM):  i live near albany too
shelly (12:26:07 PM):  Maybe that's easier to take than fiddles, accordians, and bagpipes. ;)
ariel (12:26:08 PM):  yeah, pogues are pretty hard
ariel (12:26:19 PM):  hahaha, yeah
mara (12:26:35 PM):  haha that doesnt saound to easy thats for sure
ariel (12:26:42 PM):  i like that added twist though, celtic rock is probably my favorite music
ariel (12:26:59 PM):  enter the haggis has only bagpipes and fiddle
ariel (12:27:02 PM):  no accordian
shelly (12:27:27 PM):  Kaiser Chiefs, Orleans, and something called British Sea Power are pretty good too. Love the last groups name. Pretencious, no?
vincent (12:27:41 PM):  my current favorite music is 60s and 70s Soul... but I love hip-hop, indie rock, metal, experimental music
ariel (12:27:46 PM):  hahahaha, yeah a bit
ariel (12:27:56 PM):  but i'll to check those groups out, never heard of any of them
mara (12:28:03 PM):  i cant play any instruements? can you guys?
vincent (12:28:12 PM):  I'm a drummer.
ariel (12:28:41 PM):  i can sort of play baritone horn, trumpet and piano
ariel (12:28:45 PM):  but only basics
mara (12:28:46 PM):  right vincent, i knew that about you and your band
mara (12:28:55 PM):  sort of?
ariel (12:28:57 PM):  what is your bands name vincent?
mara (12:28:59 PM):  are you being modest? haah
vincent (12:29:05 PM):  oh yeah.
vincent (12:29:17 PM):  it's called The Dead Science.
vincent (12:29:28 PM):  I play with some other bands, too, but that's my main one.
ariel (12:29:31 PM):  naw, not really, i can play them because i did it in high school but i am a bit rusty
ariel (12:29:33 PM):  :)
vincent (12:29:50 PM):  I played baritone as a kid.
ariel (12:29:51 PM):  do you have a website
ariel (12:29:54 PM):  or myspace
vincent (12:30:05 PM):  yeah, we mostly use the myspace as our website.
shelly (12:30:09 PM):  I was a drummer in my youth. Got back into it recently when my son got Rock Band 2. It's pretty fun. The game doesn't simulate drumming exactly, but it's much closer than the guitar playing. You work up a sweat.
ariel (12:30:16 PM):  i'll have to check you out
vincent (12:30:42 PM):  cool!  we're touring in June, but I'm not sure if we're playing the Albany area.
ariel (12:30:44 PM):  i wish i played a rock band type instrument
vincent (12:30:52 PM):  we're playing Brooklyn and NY for sure.
shelly (12:30:52 PM):  Cool, browsing over to it right now.
ariel (12:31:00 PM):  wow cool
vincent (12:31:27 PM):  I haven't tried rock band yet, sounds really fun.
shelly (12:31:27 PM):  Which one in the picture is you vincent?
vincent (12:31:48 PM):  I'll have to check.
ariel (12:31:49 PM):  always willing to try new music
shelly (12:32:11 PM):  Make Mine Marvel eh? That a comic reference?
vincent (12:32:20 PM):  on the right.
vincent (12:32:35 PM):  yep, MMM, of course.
shelly (12:33:09 PM):  Good stuff. You sell on iTunes?
vincent (12:33:16 PM):  my chat thing just started acting weird.
vincent (12:33:21 PM):  better now.
vincent (12:33:24 PM):  yeah, we're on itunes.
mara (12:33:33 PM):  does that every now and then
shelly (12:34:05 PM):  Wow, you been going at this since 2003? You stud! That's a hard biz.
ariel (12:34:23 PM):  wow that is impressive
ariel (12:34:28 PM):  is it your only job?
vincent (12:34:46 PM):  I haven't been in the band the whole time, but I have since 2005.  been playing music forever, though.
vincent (12:35:06 PM):  I wouldn't call it a "job," but it's what I spend the most time in my life doing...
shelly (12:35:43 PM):  LOL. Like my game design work. I love it, but a "job" indicates some reasonable level of pay, and that just ain't part of the gig.
ariel (12:35:46 PM):  well yeah i see your point, i know the guys from Enter the Haggis, tour enough that that is all they do for money
shelly (12:36:17 PM):  Cool, are the Haggis guys serious rock and rollers, or just regular guys?
ariel (12:36:42 PM):  oh they are totally just regular guys
ariel (12:36:50 PM):  they drive a van with a trailer instead of a bus
shelly (12:36:50 PM):  Nice.
mara (12:36:52 PM):  well everyone i have to go... its been just over an hour and i have a meeting at 1pm so i feel its ok to leave now
ariel (12:37:00 PM):  they always come out and talk to their fans after the shows
ariel (12:37:04 PM):  wicked wicked nice
mara (12:37:07 PM):  and ill tty all soon
ariel (12:37:12 PM):  and well super cute too
shelly (12:37:13 PM):  Bye mara. See ya next time.

vincent (12:37:14 PM):  thanks for keeping me company earlier, mara!
shelly (12:37:30 PM):  lol
ariel (12:37:33 PM):  bye mara
mara (12:37:38 PM):  no problem

ariel (12:38:08 PM):  typing up email lists they collect at shows
ariel (12:38:17 PM):  keeps them up to date
shelly (12:38:19 PM):  Okay, what's next?
ariel (12:38:40 PM):  because they tend to fall behind on the small stuff
ariel (12:38:48 PM):  hahaha yeah yeah, go check em
ariel (12:38:50 PM):  out
ariel (12:39:07 PM):  how did you find out about this research?
vincent (12:39:12 PM):  I like the dyed hair guy.
ariel (12:39:24 PM):  yeah he tends to be everyone's favorite
vincent (12:39:31 PM):  he's the cutest.
ariel (12:39:33 PM):  i like the other guitar player with glasses
vincent (12:39:45 PM):  curly hair?
ariel (12:40:00 PM):  hahaha, no, he is the bass player
ariel (12:40:07 PM):  he is cute too though but married
ariel (12:40:17 PM):  the other one with glasses
vincent (12:40:22 PM):  ouch.
ariel (12:40:32 PM):  what ouch?
ariel (12:40:42 PM):  that he is married
vincent (12:40:43 PM):  married.
vincent (12:40:52 PM):  do you think you have a shot at the guitar guy?
ariel (12:41:03 PM):  oh man i wish
ariel (12:41:05 PM):  but no
vincent (12:41:12 PM):  go for it!
ariel (12:41:29 PM):  well it is hard because they travel so much and i think he has a girlfriend
shelly (12:41:33 PM):  Not a love-em and leave-em guy?
ariel (12:41:38 PM):  and well you know they are from Toronto
ariel (12:41:46 PM):  no i don't think so
ariel (12:41:50 PM):  very sweet actually
shelly (12:41:52 PM):  I did not know that.
vincent (12:42:08 PM):  ha.
shelly (12:42:14 PM):  So how do you get the email lists? They send them to you or just give them to you when they get home?
ariel (12:42:15 PM):  yeah, they're Canadian eh
vincent (12:42:28 PM):  ha
ariel (12:42:34 PM):  when i see them at shows, i pick up what they have
ariel (12:42:38 PM):  i go see them a ton
vincent (12:42:49 PM):  so they come around albany a lot?
ariel (12:43:17 PM):  well they play the Northeast a lot
shelly (12:43:18 PM):  Sounds like my wife and They Might Be Giants. She loves them and sees them whenever they are in the area, or even close to the area. She's a fanatic.
ariel (12:43:23 PM):  and i do travel a bit to see them
ariel (12:43:45 PM):  yes shelly you could definitely call me a fanatic
vincent (12:43:48 PM):  they might be giants are super fun to see.
ariel (12:44:10 PM):  i have always wanted to see the
ariel (12:44:12 PM):  them
shelly (12:44:14 PM):  And TMBG have been at since the 80s. Yikes!
ariel (12:44:46 PM):  hahahahaha, yeah i am wondering how long i will continue to go see these guys
ariel (12:44:52 PM):  i think as long as they stay together
ariel (12:44:57 PM):  i hope they are in it for the long hall
vincent (12:45:01 PM):  for me TMBG were totally amazing the first time, then it gets a little less exciting as you get used to their "thing"
ariel (12:45:04 PM):  i just became a fan back in 2006
shelly (12:45:12 PM):  Have you noticed a change in their music at all in the time you've been following them?
shelly (12:45:27 PM):  Have they evolved or changed?
shelly (12:45:43 PM):  That's always interesting to me. Has that happened to your band vincent?
ariel (12:45:44 PM):  yeah, they are a little bit less traditional, which is ok, but i tend to like the traditional tunes they do best
vincent (12:46:29 PM):  yeah, we've changed a lot from recording to recording.  and we're all secretly jazz-playing guys, so the songs always sort of change in the details, like subtle improvisations and stuff
shelly (12:46:37 PM):  Just remembered: Great Big Sea is a great, great, celtic-oriented Canadian band. They have a really fun show.
ariel (12:46:41 PM):  i think they started off traditional because this is what got them into festivals in the celtic circuit and now they are trying to change things up a bit
ariel (12:47:00 PM):  i hope they do not go to far off this route or they might not keep their celtic rock fan base and then that could be bad
shelly (12:47:24 PM):  Interesting vincent. I didn't detect much jazz in the music in my space. Why don't you push that aspect more?
ariel (12:47:50 PM):  hahaha, funny you should mention jazz, the bass player and drummer of ETH are originally jazz musicians and i think you can sense this sometimes
vincent (12:48:01 PM):  it comes out more live, and more in maybe the older stuff (the white record with the trees on the cover)... it shows up mostly in the weird chords in the guitar stuff.
shelly (12:48:32 PM):  Listening to The Litter and the Leaves right now. Great stuff.
vincent (12:48:42 PM):  and the looseness of the drums, I get to play stuff different every time.
ariel (12:48:56 PM):  hahahahaha, ah yes that is a favorite of the new album
ariel (12:49:00 PM):  people keep mentioning it
shelly (12:49:09 PM):  Always gotta mash up the rhythms. Otherwise, it gets boring, no?
vincent (12:49:21 PM):  right.
ariel (12:49:51 PM):  got to keep things interesting
shelly (12:49:56 PM):  You know a band is tight if the drummer can mess with the rhythm and the other players follow along and the music stays good.
ariel (12:50:00 PM):  especially when you do a lot of touring i would say
vincent (12:50:25 PM):  yeah, that's my favorite thing.
vincent (12:50:37 PM):  to do and to hear.
shelly (12:50:42 PM):  How long are your shows usually vincent?
vincent (12:51:03 PM):  we don't usually play super long, 40 minutes?
vincent (12:51:16 PM):  unless we're the only band of the night, which usually doesn't happn on tour.
shelly (12:51:22 PM):  Do you have a standard play list on a tour, or do you mix it up every night?
ariel (12:51:26 PM):  do you get air time on the radio?
vincent (12:51:50 PM):  we switch it up a lot.  pretty much only college radio and indie stuff.
vincent (12:51:57 PM):  we have a little better luck with radio in Europe.
vincent (12:52:34 PM):  the radio isn't such a music-industry insitution over there... people play what they want.
ariel (12:53:02 PM):  that is cool
shelly (12:53:02 PM):  I was a college DJ. I loved playing weirdass stuff nobody ever heard of. I would play things if I thought the album cover was cool (dating myself here).
ariel (12:53:10 PM):  i wonder if ETH has looked into that
vincent (12:53:32 PM):  yeah, college radio is really special.  you can hear some stuff you wouldn't hear anywhere else.
shelly (12:53:40 PM):  Higher ups always tried to give me a playlist. I ignored them. Wasn't "employee of hte month" much. ;)
ariel (12:53:45 PM):  i always liked listening to cool stuff on college radio
vincent (12:53:48 PM):  as DJ's even, like, whoa, what's this?  let's play it?
ariel (12:54:05 PM):  they are the up and coming fans, get them interested and who knows what will happen
shelly (12:54:43 PM):  We have a station around here that run by AMC (public radio) at 97.7. They are like a college station but even more eclectic. They are on teh web too. Exit 97.7 I think.
vincent (12:54:44 PM):  totally.
ariel (12:54:46 PM):  i would have loved being a DJ except i think i would have been too shy
ariel (12:54:53 PM):  but getting to play all sorts of cool music
vincent (12:54:55 PM):  whoa!  chat freakout!!!!
ariel (12:54:58 PM):  would have been fun
vincent (12:54:59 PM):  my screen went nuts
vincent (12:55:37 PM):  you could have done the "all music, no talking" hour!
ariel (12:55:43 PM):  yeah every once and a while i get the chat in clumps
shelly (12:55:52 PM):  They've discovered us. Gak! Hide the stuff!
ariel (12:55:57 PM):  true, if only i had thought of that now
ariel (12:55:58 PM):  then
vincent (12:56:08 PM):  I don't know shelly and ariel!
vincent (12:56:15 PM):  I just got here!
ariel (12:56:33 PM):  wait what?
shelly (12:56:33 PM):  Also, you are talking to a mic. No one's around and if you play really weird stuff, you can imagine that no one is listening. That frees you up a bit.
vincent (12:56:49 PM):  nothing.  playing along with shelly's "hide the stuff" joke
ariel (12:56:52 PM):  you are i your own little world
ariel (12:57:08 PM):  my sister's friend is a dj at her school and i always bug her to play enter the haggis
ariel (12:57:22 PM):  oh i see
ariel (12:57:25 PM):  haha
shelly (12:57:26 PM):  I always knew my roomies and girl were listening so I couldn't go too far off the rails. Sometimes I would have them up in the studio and they would help me DJ. We used to read PSAs in weird voices. I was a serious troublemaker. ;)
vincent (12:57:29 PM):  is it time to stop now?
vincent (12:57:46 PM):  haha
ariel (12:57:55 PM):  now i am wishing i could have heard you,
ariel (12:58:01 PM):  must have been a blast
ariel (12:58:20 PM):  well sure i could go, i have a million things to accomplish today
shelly (12:58:26 PM):  Looks like it. Thanks for the fun chat. Maybe I'll "see" you all this weekend.
vincent (12:58:31 PM):  too bad you didn't record your shows.
vincent (12:58:47 PM):  yeah, I'm on for tomorrow.  super early (for me) again.
shelly (12:58:52 PM):  Yah, thank god. I wouldn't want that to have been preserved. Yikes!
shelly (12:59:06 PM):  Bye all.
vincent (12:59:12 PM):  bye!
ariel (12:59:20 PM):  haha, ok, bye

moderator (19:59:39 PM):  Hi guys! This is moderator.
luke (19:59:54 PM):  Hello
irene (19:59:55 PM):  Hello
cinthia (19:59:56 PM):  Hi!
melany (19:59:57 PM):  Hi moderator
moderator (20:00:23 PM):  You may begin now.
moderator (20:00:36 PM):  luke, would you mind facilitating the discussion today?
luke (20:01:13 PM):  Sure
luke (20:02:22 PM):  For today, my discussion is if you had to pick one state to live in for the rest of your life, where would it be and why?
irene (20:02:45 PM):  Wait...I thougt this was the group that you had to disuss resumes
irene (20:02:48 PM):  Am I in the right place?
cinthia (20:02:58 PM):  yes you are wrong luke
moderator (20:03:22 PM):  Yes, please review the materials on link
melany (20:03:33 PM):  link
josh (20:03:36 PM):  Yea I thought the email said the discussion was on the resumes
cinthia (20:03:36 PM):  :-D that was not supposed to be mean luke
melany (20:03:37 PM):  here's the link luke
luke (20:03:41 PM):  haha oh ok. I do not believe I saw the e-mail
moderator (20:03:47 PM):  I like the discussion idea luke, we can use it for later. :-)
rita (20:05:06 PM):  I have a question about the job description. Many of the applicants mention computer skills but the description doesn't require any. Correct?
luke (20:05:06 PM):  Oh OK even better.. You have to select, as a group, one job candidate from the candidate below for the given job.
melany (20:05:46 PM):  Correct, it does not mention any computer skills required
luke (20:05:47 PM):  From the first look, who does everyone would be the most qualified?
cinthia (20:05:50 PM):  ya rita thats corrext
ariel (20:06:05 PM):  i have a quick question... when i signed on here there were two different chats open or so i thought so... i just picked a random one is that ok?
rita (20:06:11 PM):  Do computer skills fall into the category of strong communication skills?
irene (20:06:19 PM):  I think Carla and Robert have the most relevant experience for the job
cinthia (20:06:21 PM):  go to your email... it tells u what chat you are in
irene (20:06:26 PM):  However, I think they're the least profession
ariel (20:06:28 PM):  i see kk
irene (20:06:29 PM):  *professional
josh (20:06:39 PM):  i agree with u irene
irene (20:06:46 PM):  Carla has CPR training which I think is extremely helpful for a counselor
cinthia (20:06:46 PM):  i agree about carla
melany (20:06:49 PM):  I think that Carla is the best
cinthia (20:06:53 PM):  not sure about roberth though
irene (20:07:02 PM):  Well Robert was a teaching assistant
irene (20:07:14 PM):  I don't like how he started saying how the job could help HIM
irene (20:07:24 PM):  You're supposed to say how you can help the job
melany (20:07:25 PM):  i debated between robert and emily for second place
ariel (20:07:30 PM):  hmmm i didnt get an email with a group specified
rita (20:07:34 PM):  Carla has worked with kids up to 6 years old and Robert works with College students - the target audience is 7-14 year olds. That doesn't mean they wouldn't be good though.
cinthia (20:07:35 PM):  well why i wasnt sure about robert was that who was he teaching?
jake (20:07:42 PM):  hello
cinthia (20:07:58 PM):  this is true carla
irene (20:08:05 PM):  That's true rita
irene (20:08:21 PM):  Emily said she had experience with "child care" and said nothing else about it
cinthia (20:08:23 PM):  he could still be good but I myself have worked with kids before and you have to know a good amount about the age group
josh (20:08:37 PM):  I still think carla is the most qualified
luke (20:08:45 PM):  Yea, I think it would be a lot easier for Carla to go right into this type of job compared to Robert who would have to make a pretty quick transition
melany (20:08:50 PM):  i only considered emily because she mentioned child care, majored in communications, and had experience with the red cross
melany (20:08:56 PM):  i still think carla is the best
irene (20:09:08 PM):  Yeah I think so too
cinthia (20:09:18 PM):  definitely carla... have we ruled all the others out besides carla, robert, and emily?
jake (20:09:26 PM):  i agree with melany
irene (20:09:31 PM):  She also has hobbies that are relevant to teenagers
cinthia (20:09:53 PM):  Richard at first glance seemed the worst qualified i thought
irene (20:09:57 PM):  I was personally only really interested with Carla and Robert
irene (20:10:09 PM):  Richard's resume was easy to read
irene (20:10:16 PM):  Richard was the only one who mentioned he was flexible
jake (20:10:16 PM):  carla seem to understand what it takes to take care of a 6 yr old.
melany (20:10:21 PM):  Yeah, Carla also has leadership experience as a student council vice president
irene (20:10:24 PM):  The posting said the person must be flexible
jake (20:10:34 PM):  i especially like that she described what she did with takin care of the child
irene (20:10:38 PM):  Richard and Mark seemed more business-like
irene (20:10:49 PM):  Carla didn't mention her GPA but I don't think teens really care about her GPA
cinthia (20:11:12 PM):  well it doesnt ask for college degree
irene (20:11:13 PM):  I think an interview would be necessary for all of these candidates
melany (20:11:14 PM):  I think the only good things about Richard was his flexible schedule and previous tutoring experience
luke (20:11:18 PM):  Yea and others resumes really didn't have much in them that are needed to do such a job like this
irene (20:11:18 PM):  None of them seemed horrible
rita (20:11:23 PM):  Richard wants to work in a corporate setting ... sounds like. And Mark's experience is more to do with fundraising. Neither have skills with kids listed.
josh (20:11:31 PM):  yea i dont think the gpa really matters that much as long as someone has good experience
irene (20:11:34 PM):  I agree with rita
jake (20:11:48 PM):  so, right now, who have we said that we like? its down to carla and who?
irene (20:11:52 PM):  I think the most important thing for a job is experience, rather than GPA and other jobs you've had
ariel (20:12:02 PM):  yeah i have to agree
luke (20:12:14 PM):  Robert and Carla
melany (20:12:16 PM):  i agree, experience is the most important facor
josh (20:12:20 PM):  yea
ariel (20:12:23 PM):  when you apply for a job what is most important is providing relevant information
jake (20:12:28 PM):  okay.. i vote for carla
ariel (20:12:31 PM):  it shows that you care and are truly intrested
melany (20:12:40 PM):  i also vote for carla
rita (20:12:41 PM):  It says experience "preferred" not required
irene (20:12:53 PM):  That's true
irene (20:13:18 PM):  Again, wouldn't an interview be necessary?'
josh (20:13:25 PM):  I think it should be between robert and carla though
irene (20:13:26 PM):  They should all have interviews
ariel (20:13:28 PM):  hey she has a cpr/ first aid cert
ariel (20:13:31 PM):  carla i mean
melany (20:13:32 PM):  i think robert would be responsible but not as "into" the position as carla
ariel (20:13:35 PM):  thats really important
irene (20:13:39 PM):  true
rita (20:13:44 PM):  How about references. Talking to their past supervisors might be helpful
irene (20:13:50 PM):  Oh yeah
irene (20:13:54 PM):  No one included references
melany (20:13:55 PM):  Yeah an interview is necessary
melany (20:14:02 PM):  carla could have a terrible personality
irene (20:14:03 PM):  However, the job posting didn't ask for references
josh (20:14:17 PM):  this is true
rita (20:14:20 PM):  true
cinthia (20:14:22 PM):  exactly.. usually with a resume you don't post them unless asked too
jake (20:14:47 PM):  i think robert's experience is more of a "teacher" like description. the demographics that he worked with is not what the ymca position entails
luke (20:14:49 PM):  But when it comes to working with children.. someone who has experience with them opposed to someone who has not is more likely to get the job because it really does take time to know how to act and build up a lot of patience
josh (20:15:08 PM):  thats true luke
irene (20:15:08 PM):  That's true
irene (20:15:12 PM):  But again I think we need an interview
cinthia (20:15:19 PM):  yes luke you really have to not be so much of professional but more or less be a role model
irene (20:15:20 PM):  They could write whatever they want, but they could be really awkward in person
melany (20:15:30 PM):  yes i agree
luke (20:15:30 PM):  yea you cant really judge a person on paper that well
melany (20:15:40 PM):  based on solely resumes, who would everyone pick?
irene (20:15:47 PM):  Carla
cinthia (20:15:48 PM):  carla definitely
josh (20:16:03 PM):  experience is the most important..they will deal with the kids alot better than someone without any experience
luke (20:16:07 PM):  Right cinthia thats the word I was looking for Role Model and almost an extension to their parents
irene (20:16:17 PM):  It says children ages 7-14 so they are also dealing with younger children
melany (20:16:20 PM):  i would choose carla as well
rita (20:16:58 PM):  It seems based on the job description - Emily with the communications major and the child care experience is a front runner with the information provided - I do wish she had elaborated on her child care experience
ariel (20:17:10 PM):  I am currently taking a emt class and i can tell you that the leading cause of death for children is respiratory arrest
melany (20:17:10 PM):  yes i agree
jake (20:17:11 PM):  ya... and the age group robert has an experience with is not the same as what the ymca position is asking for
melany (20:17:16 PM):  i was torn between emily and carla
melany (20:17:24 PM):  i wish she elaborated as well
irene (20:17:27 PM):  I think having CPR skills is really helpful
melany (20:17:29 PM):  she could have more experience than carla
cinthia (20:17:43 PM):  rita.. i did not even really consider emily until you said that
melany (20:17:48 PM):  and her red cross experience is helpful
luke (20:17:59 PM):  yeaa me neither
cinthia (20:18:12 PM):  what are the differences between emily and carla?
josh (20:18:15 PM):  yea but it does not say what age group emily was involved with
melany (20:18:36 PM):  there's not much description in her resume
irene (20:18:41 PM):  I think it's impossible to make the correct decision simply based on a resume
melany (20:18:41 PM):  besides her marketing experience
rita (20:18:44 PM):  I think the red cross experience is important - but anyone hired for this job will probably have to undergo training ... ergo if she has it already ...
irene (20:18:47 PM):  Even the job description is a bit vgue
irene (20:18:48 PM):  *vague
jake (20:18:56 PM):  i dont like emily's resume
luke (20:19:02 PM):  Carla cared for one single girl as opposed to Emily who put child care which could be more than one person and also could have been a different job related to this one
ariel (20:19:04 PM):  i dont either
melany (20:19:12 PM):  and no one listed their work availability, unless i missed that?
ariel (20:19:16 PM):  so? I mean emily doesnt seem put together enough to me
irene (20:19:25 PM):  The job posting says they will get training
irene (20:19:29 PM):  They might all be qualified
ariel (20:19:29 PM):  if she really wanted the job she could have put more effort into her resume
jake (20:19:37 PM):  i agree with ariel
irene (20:19:39 PM):  My first job I've ever had was a CIT at age 13
jake (20:19:46 PM):  emily's resume is bare
irene (20:19:52 PM):  I didn't get a paid job until I was 16
cinthia (20:20:11 PM):  whats a CIT?
irene (20:20:15 PM):  Counselor in Training
irene (20:20:25 PM):  I was supervised by other counselors too
irene (20:20:38 PM):  But there were times if a bunch of kids had to go to the bathroom, I'd be watching a bunch of kids on my own for a few minutes
ariel (20:20:50 PM):  you know i really wish we had some ages for these people
cinthia (20:20:52 PM):  really? even though you were so young?
irene (20:20:53 PM):  So my point is...when working with kids, you don't really need experience
melany (20:21:06 PM):  you just need to be responsible
irene (20:21:07 PM):  Well they all seem to be graduates of college
irene (20:21:11 PM):  I agree with melany
irene (20:21:21 PM):  The resumes did show responsibility
jake (20:21:21 PM):  and besides, im sure YMca will give them some training
irene (20:21:23 PM):  All of them
melany (20:21:23 PM):  they all seem pretty responsible to me
melany (20:21:31 PM):  i think they are all qualified
irene (20:21:33 PM):  Yeah
ariel (20:21:34 PM):  that could mean anything I am in undergrad with a 50 year old man who is gonna graduate next semester
jake (20:21:34 PM):  they cant just throw them into the lions
melany (20:21:36 PM):  just some would do better with others
rita (20:21:45 PM):  Well we can infer a little from dates of graduation about age
irene (20:21:48 PM):  Well a 50 year old man might have kids of his own
irene (20:21:58 PM):  Should age matter? Wouldn't that be discrimination?
rita (20:22:05 PM):  One is a masters student - he's the oldest ... most likely
cinthia (20:22:09 PM):  yes descrimination definitely
josh (20:22:18 PM):  yea age should not matter
melany (20:22:20 PM):  definetly can't discriminate based on age
cinthia (20:22:43 PM):  i work for a recruiting office for northwestern mutual and we can no matter what ask about age or personal life
melany (20:22:44 PM):  although perhaps someone younger may have more energy to deal with the kids
melany (20:22:48 PM):  but thats subjective
irene (20:22:51 PM):  Yeah
melany (20:22:56 PM):  being that some people older than me have more energy than me haha
irene (20:22:57 PM):  I'm young but kids wear me out
rita (20:22:57 PM):  would you prefer to have a 50 year old or a 20 year old working with your kids?
irene (20:23:02 PM):  It depends
ariel (20:23:06 PM):  same here
ariel (20:23:12 PM):  but i think age tells you a bit more about character
tia (20:23:17 PM):  Sorry I am coming into this late. Are you debating Carla versus Emily?
irene (20:23:19 PM):  What if it's a 50 year old mom who has 5 kids of her own
ariel (20:23:20 PM):  it helps build your idea of the person
irene (20:23:28 PM):  The 20 year old might know nothing about kids
melany (20:23:36 PM):  were still debating between everyone pretty much
cinthia (20:23:39 PM):  when i worked with kids we had older councelors that acted as the grandparents of the groups and really added to the atmosphere
jake (20:23:52 PM):  i thought we have settled between carla and robert
irene (20:23:58 PM):  The posting says "we value diversity!"
cinthia (20:23:58 PM):  they really were more respected, not as fun but more respected
melany (20:24:05 PM):  yeah i was a camp counselor and the older ones were more respected
melany (20:24:08 PM):  by far
luke (20:24:09 PM):  I don't think age really matters.. If your good with kids than thats all that matters at the end of the day.
ariel (20:24:12 PM):  what does robert have to bring again?
tia (20:24:26 PM):  Why are you considering Robert? He has no experience, nor shows any interest, in young children.
irene (20:24:28 PM):  He worked as a teaching assistant
rita (20:24:34 PM):  My three year old went to camp this past summer and the main counselor was college age and the junior counselors were high school age
tia (20:24:35 PM):  He worked in academia.
ariel (20:24:47 PM):  yes but you want diversity in the work place it matters if all your councilors are 20
irene (20:24:56 PM):  When you work with kids in a camp, a lot of times you do educational activities
melany (20:25:18 PM):  he has demonstrated an ability to lead as a TA
tia (20:25:18 PM):  I don't believe the job announcement said that diversity was the object. It was simply that there would not be discrimination.
irene (20:25:32 PM):  Well it says diversity is valued
irene (20:25:43 PM):  But I feel like jobs have to say that
ariel (20:25:44 PM):  exactly
luke (20:25:45 PM):  I work for a school aged care program at the moment and the employees ages range from 17-30... Not saying that someone older than that wouldnt be good for the job, it just seems they are more in charge of the actual office things
jake (20:25:46 PM):  but like i said, the demographics are different
tia (20:26:01 PM):  Sure, diversity is valued. But Robert is not equal in experience to Carla in this field.
jake (20:26:09 PM):  the ymca position will deal with 7-14 yr old
irene (20:26:15 PM):  Well as a teaching assistant he might work with kids of all ages
josh (20:26:24 PM):  ok so who should we definitely eliminate?
cinthia (20:26:30 PM):  good call josh
melany (20:26:38 PM):  mark? any thoughts?
melany (20:26:42 PM):  he was my first eliminated
irene (20:26:46 PM):  I really don't think we should eliminate anyone before interviewing them
tia (20:26:50 PM):  Well, that is something that could be flushed out in an interview. But if this has to be decided without an interview, then you have to judge by what they state on their resumes.
irene (20:27:13 PM):  We have another hour to talk
luke (20:27:16 PM):  yes very true
tia (20:27:19 PM):  That's good.
irene (20:27:21 PM):  It never said we can't discuss how to improve the resume
irene (20:27:26 PM):  Or how to move on after the resume
cinthia (20:27:29 PM):  and plus you cant just interview everyone who send a resume, you gotta weed out the ones that are not sufficient for the job
melany (20:27:36 PM):  exactly
irene (20:27:39 PM):  That's true cinthia
melany (20:27:41 PM):  i agree with cinthia
rita (20:27:52 PM):  ok - so i am ready to interview - let's role play ... any volunteers to be certain people for a chat interview?
irene (20:27:54 PM):  We're only looking at 5 resumes but in real scenarios we'd probably be looking at much more
rita (20:28:11 PM):  :-)
tia (20:28:13 PM):  I know I came to this late, but I'm wondering how the others were eliminated so quickly.
irene (20:28:23 PM):  I don't think it's possible to role play with the information we have
luke (20:28:27 PM):  So if we were to weed them out than it seems as though the 3 we would interview would be Emily, Jason and Carla, right?
melany (20:28:30 PM):  true
jake (20:28:36 PM):  i agree with cinthia. we have to be efficient and cut off those who dont meet what the job description says
irene (20:28:36 PM):  Jason?
luke (20:28:43 PM):  Sorry,
luke (20:28:47 PM):  Robert
cinthia (20:28:49 PM):  thats ok luke
jake (20:28:58 PM):  we only interview those that have potential
irene (20:29:08 PM):  Or we can interview everyone
melany (20:29:08 PM):  we cant interview everyone
irene (20:29:11 PM):  They all seem responsible
irene (20:29:14 PM):  It depends
irene (20:29:22 PM):  If we only got 5 applicants, we could definitely interview all 5
irene (20:29:30 PM):  If we got 100 applicants, then we'd have to narrow it down
irene (20:29:41 PM):  For our purposes I think they gave us 5 because looking at 100 applicants would be ridiculous
rita (20:30:08 PM):  If I was the person doing the interviews I would start by doing telephone interviews with each to get that additional information we don't have. Then choose the top two or three to bring in for interviews
cinthia (20:30:12 PM):  exactly irene
irene (20:30:22 PM):  Well, what kinds of questions would we ask?
tia (20:30:23 PM):  I think Mark's resume shows absolutely no interest in this job. His background is biology and fundraising. Are we all agreed, and that's 9 of us, that Mark is eliminated.
luke (20:30:32 PM):  yea
cinthia (20:30:33 PM):  yes
ariel (20:30:34 PM):  yes
irene (20:30:42 PM):  I guess we can
melany (20:30:44 PM):  i think mark was a bad candidate
josh (20:31:01 PM):  yea marks out of the discussion
irene (20:31:03 PM):  Okay
ariel (20:31:27 PM):  7/9 agree i think unless i cant count
melany (20:31:33 PM):  whose next to be eliminated?
tia (20:31:35 PM):  As for Richard, he has tutored students in grades 3-5 in science. That seems to be about his only experience related to this.
rita (20:31:50 PM):  Mark did work with the new student orientation
josh (20:32:17 PM):  yea and he said that his hours are flexible
tia (20:32:20 PM):  rita, how do you think that that relates to the YMCA position?
irene (20:32:37 PM):  New Student Orientation could be any ages
irene (20:32:42 PM):  *age
luke (20:32:51 PM):  yea and its directly dealing with kids
tia (20:33:01 PM):  But he did not tailor his resume to let us know that the ages were the same range, so should we assume that they are different?
ariel (20:33:14 PM):  i agree with tia
rita (20:33:15 PM):  Well, Robert worked with college age students and you like him ... Mark apparently worked with some college freshman too
ariel (20:33:25 PM):  he didnt really make it clear that qualified him
cinthia (20:33:28 PM):  no we shouldnt. but i never had new student orientation in elementary or middle school
cinthia (20:33:34 PM):  so i would assume its college
tia (20:33:36 PM):  I asked why Mark was being considered. I am not in favor of him.
melany (20:33:37 PM):  me either
irene (20:33:47 PM):  I'm definitely not in favor of Mark
ariel (20:33:55 PM):  same
irene (20:33:59 PM):  But I think it would be wrong to eliminate him completely before properly interviewing him
rita (20:34:08 PM):  I am playing devils advocate ... Mark's out
melany (20:34:17 PM):  Hahah I agree with rita
tia (20:34:31 PM):  I also am not in favor of Robert. His resume, in my opinion, clearly indicates to me that he is interested in college age students and academia.
irene (20:34:37 PM):  I mean if we're really picking at it
josh (20:34:48 PM):  well you cant interview everyone and we arent going to be interviewing anyone anyway
irene (20:34:52 PM):  Carla has grammar problems in her resume
melany (20:34:59 PM):  I thought Robert seemed better than Richard
jake (20:35:07 PM):  tia, that was what the point i was trying to make
josh (20:35:11 PM):  we only have the resumes to look at
irene (20:35:14 PM):  Richard was the least impressive to me
irene (20:35:30 PM):  But one thing I liked about him
irene (20:35:34 PM):  He mentioned that he's flexible
rita (20:35:37 PM):  College age students studying like English literature ... not education or communications or sports management
irene (20:35:43 PM):  And the posting said that you need to be flexible
irene (20:35:48 PM):  What if Carla is only available one day per week?
melany (20:35:55 PM):  Yeah, his flexibility seemed appealing
luke (20:36:08 PM):  Yea, they all probably should have put down times available
ariel (20:36:10 PM):  man if i were hiring i would just wait for more applicants
cinthia (20:36:14 PM):  but we really cannot even make a decision without knowing everything we need to know
ariel (20:36:14 PM):  these guys really suck
tia (20:36:16 PM):  The most important thing is for the person we hire to work well with the children in the program, and to meet the goals of the program.
irene (20:36:16 PM):  I agree with ariel
melany (20:36:21 PM):  Yeah they should have mentioned their availablity
cinthia (20:36:34 PM):  because without all the criteria we could make the wrong decision based on experience but they cant work certain days and what not
ariel (20:36:45 PM):  yep
luke (20:36:49 PM):  But than again, I would think if they are applying for a job that states you need to be available Mon-Fri from 4-8 than they would be available
irene (20:36:54 PM):  You'd be surprised
ariel (20:36:57 PM):  alre we allowed to pick no one?
irene (20:37:04 PM):  We're allowed to do whatever we want
irene (20:37:07 PM):  We have until 9:30
irene (20:37:13 PM):  So we could discuss everything about this
melany (20:37:15 PM):  Yea some may think they only have to work one dya a week
irene (20:37:36 PM):  It says "various weekend shifts" as well
irene (20:37:50 PM):  It says the Mon-Fri 4-8 is mandatory
cinthia (20:37:53 PM):  the schedule i guess would be determined in an interview
cinthia (20:38:01 PM):  for weekends anyways
melany (20:38:09 PM):  oh okay so they must think they have to work M-F
irene (20:38:12 PM):  Some jobs like to spring it on you
irene (20:38:15 PM):  Which is really annoying
luke (20:38:22 PM):  yea the mon-fri is mandatory
josh (20:38:33 PM):  yea it is
irene (20:38:36 PM):  I've worked in retail and they have this call-in nonsense where you have to wait around and call an hour or two before to see if they need you
ariel (20:38:38 PM):  this really leaves way too much to interpretation... the post looks like it was written by captain vague and well to be honest none of the applicants seem much better
irene (20:38:41 PM):  And this job might do that on weekends
melany (20:38:42 PM):  me too irene!
melany (20:38:45 PM):  worst thing ever!
irene (20:38:49 PM):  I agree melany
irene (20:38:59 PM):  I think they purposely made it all vague
tia (20:38:59 PM):  I think Carla is a strong candidate because she was a nanny for one year, has some learning in psychology, is CPR and 1st Aid certified, and has a clean driver's license (the latter meaning she might not have to rely on public transportation to get to work). I would assume, like it was mentioned earlier, that she would not be applying if she could not work out the hours.
irene (20:39:03 PM):  It gives us more to talk about
cinthia (20:39:05 PM):  who is captain vague? hah that was funny
melany (20:39:22 PM):  haha. i think the description is vague as well
irene (20:39:24 PM):  tia makes a good point
melany (20:39:43 PM):  I feel like the others may have similar qualifications as Carla
melany (20:39:47 PM):  but just dont mention it
melany (20:39:48 PM):  idk why
jake (20:39:52 PM):  havent we said before that carla is a good candidate
ariel (20:39:53 PM):  captain vague = the writer of the job discription
irene (20:39:54 PM):  I aree
melany (20:39:54 PM):  some resumes r so vague
tia (20:39:54 PM):  I think Emily is a strong candidate because she has a background in child care. As a marketing intern, she probably developed her communication skills. Also, she tailored her resume to state that her objective was to get this job.
irene (20:39:57 PM):  *I agree with melany
irene (20:40:20 PM):  I'm on a site that talks about resumes
irene (20:40:21 PM):  link
tia (20:40:32 PM):  We shouldn't be looking at any candidates who do not show interest in children in the age group of 7 to 14.
irene (20:40:43 PM):  None of them say they DONT have interest in those kids
jake (20:40:45 PM):  i agree with tia
irene (20:40:48 PM):  They all mention kids at least once
melany (20:40:54 PM):  then again i was a camp counselor and never had prior child care experience
irene (20:41:00 PM):  Yeah, that's what I meant
irene (20:41:09 PM):  When I said I was a Counselor In Training as my first job
irene (20:41:14 PM):  That was my background for future jobs
irene (20:41:18 PM):  I worked with kids before I worked in retial
jake (20:41:18 PM):  the demographics of whom the candidates had experience with matters
irene (20:41:21 PM):  They teach you
irene (20:41:22 PM):  It's not hard
irene (20:41:31 PM):  They said they will have training
melany (20:41:43 PM):  It really is a "no-brainer" type job, as long as you're responsible and willing to learn
irene (20:41:49 PM):  I agree with melany
irene (20:42:03 PM):  jake- I was thinking about that too
tia (20:42:04 PM):  When you don't have a background for the position you're looking for, you're supposed to do something with your resume to let them know why you want this job. And not because you need a job. But because this is something you're really looking for, and that you will not be a burden to your employer.
irene (20:42:18 PM):  However, some camps have counselors from different countries
irene (20:42:33 PM):  tia has made a good point
irene (20:42:45 PM):  However, Carla shows experience but she might be a mean person in real life
irene (20:42:47 PM):  She might hate kids
melany (20:42:59 PM):  Yeah she might be really shy or hard to deal with
jake (20:43:00 PM):  how would you evaluate that irene
irene (20:43:01 PM):  I forgot who said this, but based on resumes, I wasn't really impressed either
irene (20:43:05 PM):  An interview
tia (20:43:11 PM):  It could be as simple as stating that I was one of twelve children, and I know all about dealing with children. Something as to why you and the job can be a match.
irene (20:43:20 PM):  I think it would be wrong to pick someone based on a resume
irene (20:43:26 PM):  And tia made another good point
josh (20:43:28 PM):  we cant interview though
irene (20:43:35 PM):  I noticed none of these candidates really made the point why they should be hired
irene (20:43:37 PM):  Which is the purpose of a resume
tia (20:43:38 PM):  From what I could tell, we are supposed to pick based on the resumes.
melany (20:43:45 PM):  yeah they didnt make very good points
jake (20:43:49 PM):  how else would you narrow down who youll interview if you dont lok at their resume'
irene (20:43:53 PM):  True
ariel (20:43:59 PM):  i wish my roomates were here they both actually worked at the ymca
tia (20:44:01 PM):  Obviously, with the exception of Robert, these are younger people applying for the job.
irene (20:44:10 PM):  That's not necessarily obvious
tia (20:44:11 PM):  One would not expect beautiful resumes from them.
melany (20:44:15 PM):  they would provide good input ariel
irene (20:44:19 PM):  True, but I think we could all write better resumes
luke (20:44:27 PM):  sorry about that i was disconnected..
rita (20:44:39 PM):  The task is ... "Your topic of discussion will be selecting one job candidate to interview from a list of resumes for a given job."
irene (20:44:40 PM):  Carla did write her interests though
luke (20:45:02 PM):  yea so at the end of this we have to have someone
irene (20:45:04 PM):  rita, I couldn't find that...so it's good you brought it up
ariel (20:45:06 PM):  what were the gramatical errors someone found in carlas resume?
rita (20:45:07 PM):  We just have to pick who gets an interview
irene (20:45:29 PM):  I don't know I feel like Carla awkwardly worded certain parts
ariel (20:45:35 PM):  don't look at me grammer is not my forte
melany (20:45:37 PM):  I feel like grammar might not be that big of an issue as a YMCA counselor? but i could be wrong...i just assumed writing wasn't that important for the job
tia (20:45:38 PM):  The CPR/1st Aid Certified is a big plus for Carla.
irene (20:45:47 PM):  I think Carla has the most benefits
ariel (20:45:51 PM):  as do i
irene (20:45:52 PM):  She would definitely be the best to interview
irene (20:45:54 PM):  I think we all agree on that
melany (20:45:56 PM):  Yes
luke (20:45:57 PM):  yea
irene (20:45:58 PM):  But we have to talk until 9:30
melany (20:46:04 PM):  She is definetly the top candidate
irene (20:46:08 PM):  I think we should talk about what we'd ask Carla during an interview
ariel (20:46:11 PM):  lol cant we ask for another topic?
irene (20:46:17 PM):  Doubtful
rita (20:46:31 PM):  In the real world we would take like 15 minutes to pick two to have come for interviews .. done and over. In this exercise we have an hour and a half to beat it to death
ariel (20:46:32 PM):  ...
ariel (20:46:44 PM):  LOL
irene (20:47:00 PM):  That's true
melany (20:47:01 PM):  Who would be the next person we would ask to interview?
luke (20:47:03 PM):  Well the way I would go about this is if you were to pick one of these people for your own children if you had them, what would you ask them?
irene (20:47:10 PM):  Good point luke
melany (20:47:20 PM):  Hmmmm....
irene (20:47:23 PM):  Why don't we figure out what we'd ask Carla
melany (20:47:23 PM):  good question
irene (20:47:26 PM):  Then pick our next choice
ariel (20:47:30 PM):  ok
melany (20:47:30 PM):  good idea
irene (20:47:31 PM):  And figure out what to ask them
tia (20:47:32 PM):  I would ask Carla how she liked being a nanny, and why that position ended?
jake (20:47:47 PM):  or ask her what are the challenges she has had working with kids
irene (20:47:51 PM):  Good points
irene (20:48:02 PM):  And also what she likes about working with kids
rita (20:48:06 PM):  How about asking Carla how she does with multiple children
irene (20:48:08 PM):  Why does she want to work at YMCA
melany (20:48:32 PM):  what was her most difficult child care experience (similar to jake's question)
melany (20:48:38 PM):  how did she handle it
irene (20:48:40 PM):  As Student House Council Vice President, it shows that she was picked to lea
melany (20:48:50 PM):  why didnt she run for president?
luke (20:48:51 PM):  Yea and what about her separates her from the others to be able to have this job
ariel (20:48:51 PM):  hey why does carla live in boston but want to work in albany?
irene (20:48:52 PM):  I'd like to know what Lotus 1-2-3 is
irene (20:48:59 PM):  Good point ariel
tia (20:49:01 PM):  I would ask her why she became CPR/1st aid certified? Seems to me that there might be some experience she had, maybe volunteer, that that was connected with and is not on her resume.
melany (20:49:05 PM):  what subjects did she tutor?
rita (20:49:10 PM):  She attends school in Albany
irene (20:49:17 PM):  Didn't she graduate?
melany (20:49:36 PM):  nah she's still working on her masters in accounting
irene (20:49:39 PM):  Ohh
ariel (20:49:40 PM):  how long does she plan to stick around
irene (20:49:44 PM):  Good point
ariel (20:49:48 PM):  a masters can take as little as 2 years
melany (20:49:52 PM):  why does she want to work with children if her focus is accouting?
rita (20:49:53 PM):  2008 - present
ariel (20:49:55 PM):  even less if you really pile it on
rita (20:50:05 PM):  so graduation 2011
luke (20:50:05 PM):  yea thats a very good question ariel.. most places are looking for a long term employee that the kids can get used to
josh (20:50:11 PM):  well one thing that should be asked is if she can work the assigned hours and on various weekends
ariel (20:50:12 PM):  so do we want to hire someone if we dont know she is gonna stick around?
jake (20:50:20 PM):  we can also ask carla why shes interested in concentrating in psych, maybe she will maeke a connection with working with kids
melany (20:50:31 PM):  yeah good point
tia (20:50:59 PM):  I don't know if that is supposed to be a Master's.
tia (20:51:08 PM):  It states High School right before it.
tia (20:51:23 PM):  Might be, as earlier pointed out, a messy resume.
rita (20:51:30 PM):  Carla's high school concentration is psychology (I didn't know you could have a concentration in High School) anyway her college degree is in accounting
cinthia (20:51:31 PM):  well either way you dont have to have a college degree for the job
melany (20:51:33 PM):  definetly a messy resume
tia (20:51:45 PM):  Where's the BA or BS?
melany (20:51:45 PM):  yeah you could be in HS for this job
ariel (20:51:49 PM):  look here
ariel (20:51:53 PM):  link
josh (20:51:57 PM):  we could also ask to speak with the family carla was a nanny for so we can ask them how she was and why she left
irene (20:52:05 PM):  Well if you're in high school then it might be awkward if the kid is 14 and you're 15
melany (20:52:22 PM):  oh right i forgot the age group
luke (20:52:27 PM):  yea I think this job would have to be alteast 18 to qualify for
melany (20:52:28 PM):  i was thinking of the camp i worked out
melany (20:52:31 PM):  haha my mistake
melany (20:52:34 PM):  at*
ariel (20:52:35 PM):  that link was to help with what is an ma
ariel (20:52:46 PM):  sorry to be kinda random i should've labeld it :p
cinthia (20:52:49 PM):  well usually you have to be 18 or older to work with kids at the Y don't you?
cinthia (20:53:02 PM):  ok sorry didnt see your post luke
luke (20:53:27 PM):  yeaaa
irene (20:53:27 PM):  These people all have college experience so we don't have to worry about that
irene (20:53:38 PM):  But it was kind of a good point - working with kids doesn't take a genius
ariel (20:53:39 PM):  yeah
melany (20:53:43 PM):  They all are qualified, some just more than others
irene (20:53:51 PM):  If a thirteen year old can work with kids without relevant experience
irene (20:53:54 PM):  (like I did)
josh (20:53:56 PM):  yea all of the are most likely in their 20s
irene (20:53:56 PM):  Then how much do we need?
luke (20:54:06 PM):  yes but you said you were a CIT right?
tia (20:54:12 PM):  One of the things an employer looks for is to not hire someone only to have that someone leave within a couple of weeks. The employer wants someone to stay on.
irene (20:54:16 PM):  I mean we should probably take into consideration that they are the lead counselor and they need full responsibility
jake (20:54:33 PM):  yes i agree irene
ariel (20:54:35 PM):  well i was kind of thinking... like having someone who is more academically inclined might help because you do need to help kids with their homework i know that for sure since my room mate mentioned it
irene (20:54:38 PM):  Carla is probably the choice people pick without analyzing her resume
cinthia (20:54:43 PM):  i think you may be the exception to the age rule irene
melany (20:54:47 PM):  Yeah
irene (20:54:50 PM):  Not really
irene (20:54:54 PM):  There were lots of 13 year old CITS
rita (20:54:56 PM):  I just checked the YMCA website and camp counselors have to be at least 18 years of age
irene (20:55:04 PM):  But I was under supervision
ariel (20:55:10 PM):  also i think its important to note that one of my room mates that actually worked at the ymca was a elementary school teacher.. and the other was a certified RN
tia (20:55:13 PM):  I'm still at Carla's resume, and how one jumps from HS to MA. Probably supposed to be BA.
luke (20:55:20 PM):  well if you were a CIT... thats kind of a position where you dont need to have experience because that is the main job of training to become an actual couselor
irene (20:55:31 PM):  I think they purposely put someone like Carla to trick out
irene (20:55:33 PM):  *us
irene (20:55:39 PM):  She SEEMS the most qualified
melany (20:55:40 PM):  Yeah
irene (20:55:41 PM):  But she has flaws
irene (20:55:45 PM):  Location, availability, etc
ariel (20:55:50 PM):  actually tia i do want to mention that although perhaps your right there are programs at suny that allow you to take classes for both
melany (20:55:50 PM):  She's "too easy"
irene (20:55:59 PM):  If they all get training, they might be up to par or above par
ariel (20:56:14 PM):  at the same time and earn ba and ma simultaneously
tia (20:56:32 PM):  I can't imagine that that program is for the average student.
melany (20:56:34 PM):  I wonder if Carla would be persuing this career long term
irene (20:56:36 PM):  That might be true but it doesn't really matter what they have in my opinion
irene (20:56:41 PM):  Unless they're lying
irene (20:56:47 PM):  Which in that case they shouldn't get hte job
luke (20:56:55 PM):  yea
ariel (20:56:58 PM):  eh... we can pick no one at the end
ariel (20:57:04 PM):  as i said if it were me hiring
irene (20:57:13 PM):  I agree
ariel (20:57:13 PM):  i would just wait for someone better
irene (20:57:15 PM):  But
cinthia (20:57:28 PM):  that someone better may never come
melany (20:57:28 PM):  i would probably just settle and pick carla
irene (20:57:28 PM):  Might as well interview her
melany (20:57:35 PM):  depending on the demand
irene (20:57:35 PM):  It doesn't mean we have to hire her after the interview
tia (20:57:35 PM):  Why don't we begin over by agreeing what we are looking for in a candidate? Assume that the YMCA does not want quick turnover.
irene (20:57:40 PM):  We'd ask her about availability and such
tia (20:57:55 PM):  Do any of the candidates show a long-term commitment to any employment?
luke (20:57:55 PM):  Its pretty hard to decide on these people just based on their resume... they could all be really great with kids but wed never know unless you met them and saw how their personalites were
josh (20:57:58 PM):  in the end we need to select someone though
irene (20:58:11 PM):  YMCA would want someone who likes children, available during hours, available for a wide range of time, etc
jake (20:58:17 PM):  i think it woulve helped if there was an availability form they filled out
melany (20:58:18 PM):  yeah
tia (20:58:18 PM):  It doesn't help to complain about the process we are using.
ariel (20:58:21 PM):  hell i mean carla could be a really creepy lady
irene (20:58:25 PM):  We're only allowed to interview one person
melany (20:58:30 PM):  i dont understand how availablity wasnt questioned
irene (20:58:37 PM):  Might as well pick Carla sine she seems the most qualified
irene (20:58:40 PM):  I just feel that she wouldn't get hired
tia (20:58:43 PM):  It's set up this way because what we say to each other is being studied for a purpose.
irene (20:58:48 PM):  Yeah
irene (20:59:00 PM):  But I think we all brought up good points
melany (20:59:08 PM):  I agree
irene (20:59:11 PM):  Obviously if we started talking about football or something then we'd be off topic
melany (20:59:15 PM):  We overanalyzed all of them
irene (20:59:25 PM):  Agreed
irene (20:59:28 PM):  But we have another half hour
ariel (20:59:28 PM):  hey i wonder what kind of neighborhood did she work in? is it actually in existence and also what kind of neighborhood is her permanent residence like in boston?
tia (20:59:31 PM):  I don't think we've overanalyzed.
irene (20:59:40 PM):  How far is Boston from Albany anyway?
irene (20:59:45 PM):  Some people are crazy and travel every day
irene (20:59:48 PM):  If the job starts at 4pm
tia (20:59:49 PM):  It's undoubtedly set up this way for us to be quizzical.
ariel (20:59:52 PM):  2 hours by grey hound
irene (20:59:52 PM):  She could spend her day driving
ariel (20:59:55 PM):  maybe 3
irene (21:00:06 PM):  I wonder if this is a real posting
melany (21:00:11 PM):  me too
irene (21:00:15 PM):  The other group is talking about Obama
cinthia (21:00:20 PM):  i hightly doubt that
tia (21:00:22 PM):  I think we just have to accept that we are to pick one person to interview no matter what we would otherwise do in the "real world."
irene (21:00:32 PM):  Yeah
irene (21:00:39 PM):  We all clearly agree Carla is the best choice
irene (21:00:45 PM):  It doesn't mean she'll get hired
luke (21:00:46 PM):  Yes I think so
melany (21:00:51 PM):  Would anyone pick someone besides Carla?
irene (21:00:54 PM):  In the real world you can't interview every single applicant
tia (21:01:13 PM):  I think Emily is also a strong candidate.
cinthia (21:01:18 PM):  instead of still talking about carla... maybe we could talk about why we wouldn't pick another candidate?
irene (21:01:18 PM):  I was really turned off by Robert when he said what the job could do for HIM
irene (21:01:26 PM):  But I really liked his teaching assistant experience
josh (21:01:28 PM):  people can relocate for a job though..if carla would move closer to the job area then she is definitely the best choice
irene (21:01:37 PM):  And he was also participating in Drama which would probably mean he's entertaining
melany (21:01:45 PM):  I think Emily could defeat Carla if she had a better personalituy
irene (21:01:51 PM):  Emily didn't even really mention her experience with children at all
tia (21:01:59 PM):  Emily did child care.
melany (21:02:11 PM):  she would need to elaborate upon that
irene (21:02:14 PM):  Definitely
melany (21:02:16 PM):  she could have babysat once
luke (21:02:18 PM):  yeaa not really specific but its there
tia (21:02:25 PM):  What would come out in any interview is more detail than is in any of these resumes.
irene (21:02:27 PM):  Yeah she could've babysat her cousin or something
irene (21:02:42 PM):  But it says after school and on weekends
josh (21:02:43 PM):  yea it could be anything for her experience
irene (21:02:45 PM):  which is what the job is looking for
irene (21:02:48 PM):  Plus she lives in Albany
melany (21:02:50 PM):  could have been a lie
melany (21:02:53 PM):  thats a plus
irene (21:02:55 PM):  They all could be a lie
tia (21:03:01 PM):  How is babysitting a cousin not relevant if she had responsibility and did a great job?
luke (21:03:04 PM):  Well, dealing with any type of kids whether its family or someone elses it still useful experience to have
cinthia (21:03:05 PM):  but why would they lie?
irene (21:03:10 PM):  It didn't say who she provided care for, where, etc. So she could be making that up
melany (21:03:16 PM):  yeah just to get an interview
cinthia (21:03:19 PM):  either way the employer will find out and they will be fired
irene (21:03:32 PM):  Fired? I'd just say not hired at all
melany (21:03:34 PM):  unless she tells her cousin to lie for her or something
melany (21:03:35 PM):  yeah
cinthia (21:03:50 PM):  childcare is an extremely tight career and if you are untruthful you definitely get reprimanded
melany (21:03:51 PM):  i feel child care experience could be easily manipulated and embellished
irene (21:03:54 PM):  Yes
cinthia (21:03:55 PM):  future jobs can be at stake
jake (21:03:57 PM):  thats why we dont interview those who didnt elaborate on their resumes
irene (21:04:03 PM):  Therefore we should interview none of them
jake (21:04:06 PM):  coz theyre mad suspect
irene (21:04:08 PM):  Well I guess Carla we should
luke (21:04:10 PM):  yea.. without an interview we really dont know the specifics so by just basing it off the resumes you kind of have to go with it
irene (21:04:14 PM):  Yeah
irene (21:04:19 PM):  It's their fault they didn't improve their resumes
irene (21:04:30 PM):  There are plenty of sites that tell you how to create a resume
irene (21:04:32 PM):  Just google it
josh (21:04:43 PM):  yea and thats all we have to choose from is there resumes
luke (21:04:44 PM):  yeaa
irene (21:04:49 PM):  Real employers aren't going to all be like, "I bet they could possibly have a good personality!"
melany (21:04:55 PM):  hahaha exactly
irene (21:04:58 PM):  They don't want to waste their time and efforts on who COULD be good
jake (21:05:08 PM):  duhhh
luke (21:05:12 PM):  yea they arent very good
melany (21:05:12 PM):  something on paper needs to jump out at them
irene (21:05:14 PM):  So in the real world, Carla would probably be the only one they'd care about
irene (21:05:20 PM):  Because she has qualities that stick out
tia (21:05:21 PM):  I think new job seekers have to be given a break. They can't be expected to have the wonderful resumes that come with experience. And that is experience that teaches one that it is okay to "brag" about what one has done.
ariel (21:05:22 PM):  time + effort cost money'
irene (21:05:38 PM):  It doesn't have to be wonderful
irene (21:05:39 PM):  But for example
irene (21:05:42 PM):  Carla wrote her interests
irene (21:05:47 PM):  And those interests would most likely be done at camps
irene (21:05:51 PM):  The other people might not have experience
jake (21:05:57 PM):  and carla described what she did
ariel (21:06:03 PM):  personally if i had no experience then i would write something about why i think i would be a good candidate anyway
irene (21:06:05 PM):  But they could've put something like enjoys arts and crafts, sports, etc
tia (21:06:09 PM):  That's why I'm a bit hung up on Carla and the jump from H.S. to M.A. If she is older than I initially thought her to be (undergraduate age), then her resume should be much better.
irene (21:06:15 PM):  True
melany (21:06:22 PM):  Yeah I am curious about that as well
irene (21:06:45 PM):  I don't get why these things are an hour and a half
ariel (21:06:47 PM):  thats not true i mean someone could graduate at 17 and finish there masters by age 23
tia (21:06:48 PM):  There are many ways to truthfully embellish a resume.
ariel (21:06:49 PM):  thats not that old
irene (21:07:01 PM):  Age shouldn't be a factor
tia (21:07:07 PM):  But there are years not accounted for on her resume.
ariel (21:07:11 PM):  i am 21 i dont have much experience with jobs because school is my main focus
melany (21:07:20 PM):  yeah same
irene (21:07:29 PM):  Before you graduate you should at least get an internship relating to what kind of job you want
irene (21:07:32 PM):  And you could get credits for those
luke (21:07:42 PM):  yess easier said than done sometimes though
tia (21:07:44 PM):  ariel, do you indicate the year you got your HS diploma? Dates you are in college? Dates you worked at a job?
irene (21:07:51 PM):  I mean some of the people applying went to SUNY Albany which offers internships so they have no excuse
cinthia (21:07:55 PM):  luke i have had three in the past two years
ariel (21:08:06 PM):  i dont know if i could get an internship after college ...
irene (21:08:10 PM):  It's tough
ariel (21:08:19 PM):  not with my type of job espcially
irene (21:08:20 PM):  But I'm just saying, if you have NEVER had experience
ariel (21:08:23 PM):  it all depends
irene (21:08:25 PM):  There are always places you could volunteer for free
irene (21:08:28 PM):  Especially relating to kids
luke (21:08:37 PM):  3? very impressive you should be ready to jump into that real world cinthia
irene (21:08:39 PM):  There's UKids on campus which allows you to work there for free for class credits
josh (21:08:39 PM):  yea places usually dont give interships if you graduate
rita (21:08:52 PM):  This YMCA gig doesn't require prior experience so it would be considered an entry level position right?
irene (21:08:56 PM):  Yes
ariel (21:08:58 PM):  and to answer you tia of course i would put all the dates down... im just saying there could be a reason
irene (21:09:03 PM):  Experience preferred but not necessary
melany (21:09:09 PM):  I think it is an entry level position
irene (21:09:19 PM):  I think it's definitely important to take into account empty dates
rita (21:09:21 PM):  Everyone needs to start somewhere
irene (21:09:23 PM):  Jobs definitely do that
melany (21:09:58 PM):  Yeah exactly
tia (21:10:12 PM):  ariel, do you think the reason some people don't put the dates down is because they want to "hide" periods of unemployment, etc., so that they do not get initially screened out and have the opportunity to meet the employer face-to-face to explain?
ariel (21:10:20 PM):  i agree that she should have put down that she is going for her ba and ma or that she finished it already
rita (21:10:29 PM):  My first two jobs ever were babysitting and day camp junior counselor ... while I was in middle school
ariel (21:10:31 PM):  but i dont think we should knock her compleatly due to that
irene (21:10:51 PM):  That's just something we can ask in an interview
melany (21:10:54 PM):  yeah sometimes people struggle with personal issues
tia (21:10:55 PM):  I'm not saying we should knock her completely. I'm thinking that we should further analyze.
melany (21:10:56 PM):  exactly
luke (21:10:57 PM):  thats true
ariel (21:11:03 PM):  yeah i agree
irene (21:11:05 PM):  But really, as long as they're willing to learn - for this type of job - training is given and whatever she doesn't know she can learn
josh (21:11:06 PM):  yes very true
rita (21:11:10 PM):  Oh, luke to answer your original question ... Washington State ... no state income tax
irene (21:11:24 PM):  Maybe Carla didn't work because she had kids
cinthia (21:11:25 PM):  Hawaii
luke (21:11:36 PM):  So with about 20 minutes left, are we definately set on a person or maybe 2 top people?
jake (21:11:43 PM):  carla
jake (21:11:45 PM):  hands down
irene (21:11:48 PM):  Carla is clearly our top choice
cinthia (21:11:50 PM):  carla
melany (21:11:50 PM):  yes
josh (21:11:52 PM):  yes
luke (21:11:57 PM):  ok good
irene (21:12:02 PM):  It doesn't say we need a second choice
cinthia (21:12:02 PM):  all in favor of carla say aye
irene (21:12:06 PM):  But I guess we might as well
ariel (21:12:06 PM):  aye
melany (21:12:07 PM):  aye
irene (21:12:08 PM):  aye
jake (21:12:08 PM):  AYEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
ariel (21:12:11 PM):  lol
josh (21:12:14 PM):  i
rita (21:12:18 PM):  Carla and Emily
cinthia (21:12:22 PM):  hahhah josh
cinthia (21:12:26 PM):  :-D
jake (21:12:27 PM):  nah, only one person it said
irene (21:12:31 PM):  Yeah
irene (21:12:33 PM):  but we still need to talk
ariel (21:12:35 PM):  yeah carla
melany (21:12:37 PM):  so we choose carla?
jake (21:12:40 PM):  si
ariel (21:12:45 PM):  hai!
melany (21:12:47 PM):  congrats carla
irene (21:12:51 PM):  What do you think they're looking for ?
tia (21:12:52 PM):  Carla and Emily. But again, CPR and First Aid are definite pluses for Carla.
rita (21:13:19 PM):  For emily ... right - she's the red cross chick
irene (21:13:27 PM):  Oh yeah
irene (21:13:33 PM):  so she has experience in case something goes wrong
luke (21:13:40 PM):  yea..
irene (21:13:46 PM):  I feel like jobs just glance over resumes though
rita (21:13:48 PM):  Ooops Carla
irene (21:13:50 PM):  So in real life, Carla would get the interview
luke (21:14:01 PM):  sounds like it
rita (21:14:03 PM):  sure
josh (21:14:25 PM):  yea i like carla for the interview
melany (21:14:26 PM):  I wonder if they were only looking to hire one person?
melany (21:14:29 PM):  does it say?
ariel (21:14:34 PM):  lol this is gonna sound crazy but another room mate had volunteered for disaster relief and he had cpr training... but its expired now because it has to be re done every few years
ariel (21:14:47 PM):  i know... i have 8 room mates :p
irene (21:14:54 PM):  Wow
irene (21:14:59 PM):  Roommates or suitemates?
cinthia (21:15:03 PM):  i have 9 roommates
ariel (21:15:12 PM):  uhhh i live off campus in a big house so....
melany (21:15:18 PM):  ohhhhh that makes sense
tia (21:15:24 PM):  Yes, they have to be re-certified CPR every few years.
cinthia (21:15:27 PM):  ditto it gets a little girl razy
ariel (21:15:31 PM):  i think its every 2
tia (21:15:36 PM):  Could be.
ariel (21:16:04 PM):  The red cross is one year, the american heart association is 2 years.
ariel (21:16:11 PM):  for cpr cert
melany (21:16:15 PM):  oh wow
ariel (21:16:23 PM):  so she is no longer certified i bet
josh (21:16:46 PM):  she could re test for it tho
tia (21:16:48 PM):  Guys, don't be so untrustworthy.
ariel (21:17:10 PM):  besides i will tell you from talking to the paramedics at my emt class that cpr techniques do change
ariel (21:17:15 PM):  so it is important
melany (21:17:17 PM):  ive heard that too
melany (21:17:23 PM):  expecially dealing with children
ariel (21:17:26 PM):  yes
irene (21:17:31 PM):  Again, they all get training
irene (21:17:35 PM):  The fact she has any experience is good
ariel (21:17:35 PM):  they have found better methods and such
tia (21:17:43 PM):  The resumes are not the best in format, grammar, and style. But that doesn't make people liars. Hiding periods of unemployment, etc., is a normal acceptable technique; one just has to be on the look-out for it.
rita (21:17:48 PM):  I still be anyone who gets hired for this job to work with youth will be required to do the trainning
rita (21:17:56 PM):  * I still bet
melany (21:18:00 PM):  yeah regardless of prior experience
luke (21:18:04 PM):  If you were going to interview her, what do you think the most important question would be? Would you rather hire somebody who is OK with kids but available all the times or someone who is great but not available as much
tia (21:18:20 PM):  Depends on entire staffing
melany (21:18:23 PM):  i'd choose the most available
jake (21:18:26 PM):  and if ever theyre mad suspect for leaving out info on their resumes, then we can ask them in the interview
ariel (21:18:31 PM):  what does this "training" include? i mean its costly to train people for cpr and first aid
melany (21:18:35 PM):  thats just what i've experienced while interviewing
ariel (21:18:40 PM):  especially if you have a high turn over rate
melany (21:18:40 PM):  they usually pick the most available
rita (21:18:42 PM):  In this economy you have the ability to get both
melany (21:18:45 PM):  then again it depends on the job
luke (21:19:13 PM):  sometimes with training... the person pays for it or their job pays them hourly depending on how much it is since they are doing it for work
cinthia (21:19:27 PM):  yeah i got paid for my training
luke (21:19:32 PM):  samsies
melany (21:19:35 PM):  me too
tia (21:19:52 PM):  So, are we agreeing that we need someone who will stick with the job?
irene (21:20:05 PM):  Well we don't know if Carla will stick or not
irene (21:20:07 PM):  She might
tia (21:20:14 PM):  If so, the job has to be a good match for the person.
irene (21:20:17 PM):  I think we should stick with who's the most qualified and go on from there
josh (21:20:23 PM):  well at least the person needs to be able to complete the hours
melany (21:20:28 PM):  yes
melany (21:20:30 PM):  they do
tia (21:20:44 PM):  And the person has to have the ability to commit. Are these candidates too new to the world of work do have shown such a commitment in the past?
luke (21:20:54 PM):  yeaa its tough you need someone to be there for the hours but they also need to good at what they do
irene (21:21:00 PM):  Yeah
melany (21:21:20 PM):  Tough predicament
luke (21:21:22 PM):  you dont want someone who sucks with kids but has a lot of free time so they can work 7 days a week haha
irene (21:21:29 PM):  True
tia (21:21:42 PM):  Would you stick at a job that did not use your skills, required you to develop skills you did not foresee any future need for, and have you around kids that you find annoying?
rita (21:21:43 PM):  Availability is a big deal ... when you are new at any job you will not get far unless you bend over to meet their schedule.
melany (21:21:50 PM):  i agree
irene (21:22:01 PM):  They're all getting training
tia (21:22:13 PM):  Would you be taking the first opportunity to leave the job at the YMCA for a better job?
melany (21:22:14 PM):  the more available you are the more likely you are to absorb good experience
cinthia (21:22:31 PM):  or a bad one... ;-)
luke (21:22:38 PM):  well if someone needs money and theres a job that they think they can get they may take it even if they dont like it... which is pretty common actually
josh (21:22:43 PM):  yea and you never know if someone is going to leave a job
tia (21:22:44 PM):  7 to 14 is not an easy age group
josh (21:22:48 PM):  anything can happen
jake (21:22:49 PM):  i agree
melany (21:22:51 PM):  they are difficult
rita (21:22:52 PM):  that really isn't something the employer can infer at an interview ... if you will leave
irene (21:22:53 PM):  Yeah
rita (21:23:15 PM):  there is always that risk
melany (21:23:42 PM):  at least we decided on carla
cinthia (21:23:45 PM):  ya they can ask trick questions though like where do you see yourself in 5 years
irene (21:23:49 PM):  Hahhaah
luke (21:24:04 PM):  yeaa
irene (21:24:17 PM):  I think we should round up and say it's 9:30
irene (21:24:23 PM):  How do we get the $10?
rita (21:24:33 PM):  Hmmm a gold medalist in the 2014 olymipcs
melany (21:24:50 PM):  I think they pay us at the end of the study
rita (21:24:50 PM):  in 5 years
ariel (21:24:51 PM):  ooooo $10!!!!!!
melany (21:24:52 PM):  in a check
luke (21:24:53 PM):  they count all the hours up at the end of the month and u get a check
melany (21:25:01 PM):  oh its the end of the month?
luke (21:25:04 PM):  yup
melany (21:25:06 PM):  great
tia (21:25:07 PM):  So, I guess it's Carla to be interviewed.
irene (21:25:11 PM):  Yeah'
luke (21:25:13 PM):  after all of the online sessions
ariel (21:25:18 PM):  i wonder if they take into account that we may be a minority due to the fact that we are doing this for money
irene (21:25:18 PM):  I see
irene (21:25:28 PM):  What do you mean ariel
cinthia (21:25:36 PM):  what
ariel (21:25:43 PM):  well for example we have to value money
ariel (21:25:44 PM):  for one
ariel (21:25:49 PM):  and not have enough
ariel (21:25:51 PM):  or want more
ariel (21:26:02 PM):  enough in order to be willing to do this for money
irene (21:26:13 PM):  Yeah but we still have to discuss the topic
melany (21:26:23 PM):  true
irene (21:26:33 PM):  We didn't choose the topics
irene (21:26:39 PM):  We all had valid points
luke (21:26:45 PM):  lol well its a good thing theres about 4 minutes left cause this topic has run its course
irene (21:26:46 PM):  But we're all Albany students
rita (21:26:51 PM):  It's all part of the statistical variables of the study ... right?
ariel (21:26:52 PM):  yeah but dont our ethical values impact how we would discuss a topic such as this?
irene (21:26:56 PM):  So it could technically not be a representative sample
jake (21:26:59 PM):  yes i think so
irene (21:27:03 PM):  UAlbany students, certain age group, etc
jake (21:27:14 PM):  and background and experience
jake (21:27:17 PM):  and age
cinthia (21:27:19 PM):  i think they just needed participants
ariel (21:27:20 PM):  yes exactly irene!
irene (21:27:21 PM):  And maybe some of us wouldn't have picked Carla if other didn't say so
irene (21:27:25 PM):  Or if others didn't make points
irene (21:27:30 PM):  I certainly didn't think of Emily as a choice
jake (21:27:33 PM):  tru
tia (21:27:34 PM):  We're apparently one of eight centers doing this study

george (8:26:17 PM):  good evening!
rachael (8:26:26 PM):  Hello!
rachael (8:26:48 PM):  I'm sure someone else is supposed to be here/
george (8:27:24 PM):  i think several people are
rachael (8:28:11 PM):  Well, we're just the punctual ones.
george (8:28:45 PM):  hello
amy (8:28:59 PM):  Hey everyone
george (8:29:24 PM):  i got tapped to "lead" the chat tonight :)
amy (8:29:38 PM):  Oh ok, i was just wondering about that
rachael (8:29:42 PM):  Hi amy.  What's the topic, george?
amy (8:29:48 PM):  This is my first attendance
george (8:30:16 PM):  i was thinking of economic topics...starting with bernie madoff ^_^
amy (8:30:41 PM):  l i have general knowledge but nothing too specific
rachael (8:31:27 PM):  There's a great Woody Allen story in the New Yorker this week about two men, reincarnated as lobsters, attaching Bernie Madoff.
george (8:31:34 PM):  do you know what a ponzi scheme is?
rachael (8:32:08 PM):  I meant attacking.  He outPonzied Ponzi.
amy (8:32:08 PM):  i have heard that term ponzi recentlybut cant recall what itis, so no
george (8:32:38 PM):  hehe rachael
george (8:33:13 PM):  ok, here's how a ponzi scheme works...i tell you that if you let me handle your investments, i'll give you great returns
george (8:33:34 PM):  so you hand over your money and i go eat well
amy (8:33:40 PM):  i do know that it is horible that so many people were so affected-  by one person with no ethics
rachael (8:34:02 PM):  In a Ponzi scheme, I would convince george to invest $5 by promising him $10.  Then I would get you to invest $10 and give that $10 to george.  I'd keep doing this until I went to jail.
george (8:34:05 PM):  then when you want to cash out your investments, i take money from somebody else much in a similar situation to yours, and pay you with their money
amy (8:34:28 PM):  got it
george (8:35:01 PM):  so basically to keep it running, you need new investors constantly
amy (8:35:26 PM):  and why do people turn the other way afer they hand over their money?
rachael (8:35:34 PM):  I understand his wife is still socking away money and living in their Park Ave. penthouse.
george (8:35:42 PM):  madoff's problem was that he didn't have enough money to pay people that needed the money as the economy tanked
amy (8:35:57 PM):  or did he provide falsified papers to "prove" he was helping their financial situations?
rachael (8:36:07 PM):  Well, they got statements that showed that their money was growing.
george (8:36:23 PM):  yes, the ponzi scheme is fraud...statements were falsified
george (8:36:49 PM):  ok so here's where i find it gets interesting...
rachael (8:37:07 PM):  It sounds as though running a Ponzi scheme is more work than actual investing, but, of course, the crook keeps th emoney.
george (8:37:11 PM):  apparently some charity got bankrupted by madoff's ponzi scheme
amy (8:37:38 PM):  yes rachael- i was wondering that too!  why even bother
amy (8:38:05 PM):  oh no-  do u know what charity?
george (8:38:07 PM):  if we could show that people starved to death because a charity was unable to sustain their services due to madoff, should he be held accountable for their deaths?
rachael (8:38:12 PM):  Friends of ours know the Madoff accountant, who has a two-erson accounting firm in New City.  He's been arrested.  His daughter goes to the local highschool and is humiliated.
rachael (8:38:26 PM):  *two-person
amy (8:38:39 PM):  very embarassing and beyond for anyone connected to him
amy (8:38:53 PM):  interesting george....
george (8:39:30 PM):  ok i'll look up the charity, there's many other entities that got ripped off as well, and the effects no doubtedly trickled down
amy (8:39:45 PM):  my initial reaction to your questions is no
george (8:40:31 PM):  hmm can't seem to paste in here
rachael (8:40:48 PM):  I don't think he'd be legally liable, because there are other charities, and you could just as well hold the bankrupt chariry liable for not finding new funding, which sounds farfetched.  I think some colleges have been affected too, and may charities.
george (8:40:48 PM):  Spielberg charity (Wunderkinder foundation)
amy (8:40:57 PM):  but there is definitely ehtical issues about the whole thing.....to me it sounds like madoff might even have some kind of power issue/control/arrogant.....dare i say similar to spitzer...
george (8:41:14 PM):  Mortimer b. zuckerman, a charitable trust
george (8:41:24 PM):  a jewish charity
rachael (8:41:32 PM):  A lot of Jewish charities and institutions trusted him, I gather.
george (8:42:12 PM):  yea, i can't say for sure anybody starved to death because of him, but it definitely had an impact on many people
george (8:42:34 PM):  indirectly that is
amy (8:42:40 PM):  in normal cirumstances, which is how i try to understand the situation.....
amy (8:42:53 PM):  a consumer is under the idea of "buyer beware".....
rachael (8:43:00 PM):  Madoff vs Spitzer sounds full of potential.  Two very entitled guys!
george (8:43:34 PM):  yea, what was that animated show?  celebrity showdown?
amy (8:43:37 PM):  but if something really goes wrong there is the opportunity to sue, or take legal action to get your money back...i'm thinking along  the lines of purchasing a defective product for example
amy (8:43:49 PM):  lol  i like the vs
george (8:44:07 PM):  well, there is an inherent risk with all investments, but this is outright fraud
rachael (8:44:10 PM):  There are stories about elderly people who have had to sell their houses and start working again, because of Madoff.  They're being allowed to redo their taxes to adjust for earnings they thought theyhad, but didn't.
amy (8:44:16 PM):  in this case, there is no where to get help to plead yourcase....the $ is just gone
george (8:44:53 PM):  also, his wife has millions in her name...does anybody doubt some if not all of it came from his investors?
george (8:45:02 PM):  as well as his sons
amy (8:45:10 PM):  very sad   this will definitely turn many lives upside down and have riple effects for a long time
rachael (8:45:14 PM):  People will recover some, but apparently the authorities are having trouble finding the money.
george (8:45:19 PM):  and he's made donations to politicians
rachael (8:45:32 PM):  Spitzer, Masybe?!?
amy (8:45:38 PM):  lol
rachael (8:45:47 PM):  *maybe.  My typing is terrible this evening.
amy (8:45:56 PM):  i gotcha
george (8:45:58 PM):  haha you're a big spitzer fan, aren't you!
amy (8:46:42 PM):  what do you guys think would be best for madoff's punishment--   jailtime??
rachael (8:46:42 PM):  A disappointed Spitzer fan,  I voted for him and thought he would be a great governor.
amy (8:47:08 PM):  i mean, in my mind it seems he shouldnt have the opportunity to sit around, but rather he should work for the $ he lost
george (8:47:17 PM):  imo, madoff's sons and wife should start from scratch and have their belongings distributed to the victims
rachael (8:47:24 PM):  Having his wife reduced to poverty while he sits in jail would be the best punishment for him.
amy (8:47:27 PM):  this is just ideally speaking not reality of course
george (8:47:44 PM):  yes, i agree rachael- as well as his sons
rachael (8:48:05 PM):  I think reality is what, 150 years, according to the papers?  He'll be sentenced in June.
amy (8:48:14 PM):  i also voted for him, spitz, rachael and felt betrayed
amy (8:48:32 PM):  yeah some high # like that which makes no sense
george (8:48:35 PM):  ok so we can see how ponzi schemes have a ripple effect...now what if i told you there's way bigger ponzi schemes going on!
amy (8:48:51 PM):  i totally believe it!  and know it
rachael (8:48:52 PM):  I would be upset!
rachael (8:49:09 PM):  Tell us all!
amy (8:49:18 PM):  and what happened to spitzer....well he was just caught
george (8:49:23 PM):  uh oh, i'm going to make you upset rachael!
rachael (8:49:45 PM):  Go on!
amy (8:49:58 PM):  she seems ager!
amy (8:50:00 PM):  eager!
rachael (8:50:18 PM):  No, just ready...
george (8:50:54 PM):  i believe we're something like 14 trillion dollars in debt now right?
rachael (8:51:10 PM):  Hmm...
george (8:51:23 PM):  well, the US has about 50 billion in reserves
george (8:51:45 PM):  they raise money two ways...one by selling treasury bonds
george (8:51:57 PM):  (well excluding taxes)
george (8:52:10 PM):  the other by firing up the printing press
rachael (8:52:29 PM):  Let me guess..
george (8:52:38 PM):  wow...i'm not sure i started in the right place
george (8:52:56 PM):  it goes back to the average consumer, house buyer, etc
george (8:53:25 PM):  but yea, one of the largest buyers of treasury bonds...is China!
rachael (8:53:42 PM):  We're a fully owned subsidiary?
george (8:53:46 PM):  so they are borrowing money to throw at bailing out AIG, citi, etc
george (8:54:12 PM):  you mean owned by china?
george (8:54:30 PM):  not quite there yet, but headed in that direction
rachael (8:54:30 PM):  yes.
george (8:55:05 PM):  here's the thing...china buys our treasury bonds...we throw that money into a black hole..not use it to increase our productivity
george (8:55:18 PM):  then to pay them back we have to borrow more money
george (8:55:34 PM):  or fire up the printing press and create more money out of thin air
amy (8:55:39 PM):  if you know this, then why havent others disputed it
rachael (8:55:52 PM):  from China!  And then we borrow more to buy more products from China!
george (8:56:06 PM):  but when we print money, that's inflation...devaluing the dollar reduces the return of treasury bonds
george (8:56:25 PM):  yes, that's the other thing rachael...we buy their products more than they buy ours
rachael (8:56:58 PM):  I realized the past few days that I don't really know what devaluing the dollar means.
george (8:57:03 PM):  amy- politicians should be aware of this.  look up ron paul and the speeches he has been giving.  and how he's ignored
george (8:57:59 PM):  when the fed prints money, that increases the money supply.  let's say $100 exists in a micro economy
amy (8:58:02 PM):  i'm sure morhigher ups than not know whats going on but nobody wants to expose- cause change....well maybe over the next few yrs
george (8:58:17 PM):  if i decide to print another $100, our money just got its value halved
george (8:58:45 PM):  we now have $200 representing a $100 economy
george (8:59:03 PM):  goods we buy have to increase in price since our money is worth less
rachael (8:59:12 PM):  OK. I see.
rachael (8:59:33 PM):  So even our original $100 buys less that it used to.
rachael (8:59:39 PM):  *than
amy (8:59:45 PM):  i have been seeing more about buying local-   regarding food mostly
george (8:59:58 PM):  so here's the thing...china is seeing that the amount of debt we've accumulated is so large that it's getting less likely we'll be able to pay it back
amy (9:00:14 PM):  but that is a good start-   to inform and educate people so this cycle we've created can be reduced somehow in the future
george (9:00:24 PM):  and when we print money, their interest gets devalued from the treasury bonds
rachael (9:00:48 PM):  So if they stop buying our treasury bonds, what happens?
george (9:01:11 PM):  hehe...then the bond market bubble collapses
rachael (9:01:26 PM):  What does that mean?
george (9:01:31 PM):  that's when you see the true economic disaster looming over our heads materialize
amy (9:01:36 PM):  would that be a good thing for the long term?
george (9:01:45 PM):  that means the federal government runs out of borrowed money
george (9:02:00 PM):  they are going to print more money nonstop to keep things going
amy (9:02:03 PM):  i seems inevitable sometimes-  get worse before it gets better
george (9:02:12 PM):  so you know your 401k that they aren't allowed to touch?
george (9:02:34 PM):  they're going to extract the value from them by devaluing the $
rachael (9:02:47 PM):  OH!
george (9:02:59 PM):  you've saved $100, right?  well it's going to be worth $50 when they print more money and use it
george (9:03:27 PM):  and that will collapse the final bubble, the value of the dollar itself
george (9:04:11 PM):  at that point, we'll need wheelbarrows to cart our money around just to buy a loaf of bread...just like good ole zimbabwe
rachael (9:05:00 PM):  I some blind faith in the system and our "leaders" that it won't happen, but Maybe I'm just in denial.
george (9:05:11 PM):  hehe i wish that was just a doomsday paranoia, but you can look up the numbers and see yourself
amy (9:05:13 PM):  with the knowledge you have george, because you seem to udnerstand economics...what is your opinion-  will it collapse or do you have faith things will turn?
george (9:05:46 PM):  unfortunately every time you look at the news, it's more bad news
rachael (9:06:18 PM):  Do you have the feeling that Geithner et al are sort of helpless?
george (9:06:19 PM):  prices of houses should be lower, markets are attempting to readjust downwards, but the government is interfering
amy (9:06:40 PM):  i do know that people dont understand things until they are personally affected...maybe now that some of this is hitting home....people will begin to take the opportunity to educate themselves and others around them
george (9:07:23 PM):  have you heard of peter schiff?
amy (9:07:29 PM):  no
george (9:07:40 PM):  that's a good place to start learning about this mess, look him up on youtube
rachael (9:07:58 PM):  I am personally affected!  My retirement plan at work has lost so much money that I'm taking our extra life insurance just in case sonething happens to me.  Of course I have to pay for that insurance.
amy (9:08:40 PM):  my b-friend has been let go....4 months and no bite anywhere
george (9:08:47 PM):  but yea, the government is basically running a big ponzi scheme
amy (9:08:56 PM):  it is certainly affecting most in some way
rachael (9:08:58 PM):  The IRS is hiring - not a joke.
amy (9:09:32 PM):  hmm  i'll have to check out their career site
george (9:09:35 PM):  amy, the "optimists" are saying it's going to bottom out at the end of the year
george (9:09:58 PM):  they think it will improve starting next year, i hope so
rachael (9:10:05 PM):  But "bottom out" doesn't sound good.
george (9:10:23 PM):  but to be honest, i am not sure we can avoid a hyperinflationary depression
rachael (9:10:55 PM):  Ok, what's a hyperinflationary depression?  What would it mean?
amy (9:11:02 PM):  when things get bad in life, it seems itas to be really bad to turn back around-  justan observation and not from an econmic perspective
george (9:11:04 PM):  maybe just a high inflation not hyperinflation
george (9:11:31 PM):  hyperinflation means inflation has gotten out of control and one day a loaf of bread will be $100, the next day it might be $200
rachael (9:11:53 PM):  I'm more comfortable with $2.99.
amy (9:12:05 PM):  but no one would buy it for high prices
rachael (9:12:17 PM):  And how does hyperinflation combine with depression?
george (9:12:53 PM):  well, let me see if i can get the definition of depression right...it's categorized by a high double digit unemployment
george (9:13:05 PM):  scarcity of goods
george (9:13:32 PM):  big contraction in GDP...let me look it up real quick :P
rachael (9:14:10 PM):  But amy, if that's what food cost, what would we do?
george (9:14:20 PM):  shrinking output and investment, numerous bankruptcies, restriction of credit, devaluations
rachael (9:14:43 PM):  Haven't you just described what's going on now?
george (9:15:08 PM):  yea, pretty much...but what's going on now is still being referred to as a "recession"
amy (9:15:11 PM):  it would have to come down in price so the sellers could make something off it.  if we dont have mone then we only buy whats necessary right?
george (9:15:28 PM):  it can get much much worse if those last two bubbles in the bond market and $ collapse
george (9:15:51 PM):  amy- sellers couldn't lower the price because the $ would be worth very little
george (9:16:19 PM):  you probably would earn more at that point, but your savings would be wiped out
amy (9:16:19 PM):  but how would anyone have enough to purchase anthing at all
rachael (9:16:34 PM):  And their costs would be as affected as ours would.  We couldn't save $ by baking our own bread, because flour would cost too much.
george (9:16:45 PM):  you could earn $40,000 a week
george (9:17:14 PM):  let me see if i can find the price of bread in zimbabwe
amy (9:17:38 PM):  but wouldt the person selling it for lower price still be making money while the person with the high price will not be making any money regardless of the price
rachael (9:17:57 PM):  I think things have improved in Zinbabwe recenty.   Didn't the same thing happen in Germany in the 1930s?
george (9:18:16 PM):  their central bank prints a new 100 billion dollar note
rachael (9:18:26 PM):  Oh.
rachael (9:18:39 PM):  And what does that buy?
george (9:18:42 PM):  yes, weimar republic
george (9:19:41 PM):  in germany, they were burning money- as that was cheaper than buying wood to burn
george (9:20:58 PM):  hmm...i might have chosen a bit of a depressing topic, huh...no pun intended :P
rachael (9:21:07 PM):  But most of us have money in the system somewhere, rather than having stacks of cash.  So our money is more exposed; I'm not sure how to describe what I mean.
george (9:21:54 PM):  do you know what people traditionally invest in to "hedge" against inflation?  gold
rachael (9:22:09 PM):  I wish I had some!
george (9:22:19 PM):  one ounce of gold in early 1900's bought a suit at around $35
george (9:22:34 PM):  an ounce of gold now costs over $900
george (9:23:06 PM):  designer suit back then, designer suit now...funny how that works out.  gold retains its value
amy (9:23:57 PM):  it is a not so happy topic but its good to get people talking
amy (9:24:05 PM):  so not to ignore issues
rachael (9:24:28 PM):  Gold is vulnerable to theft and loss, though.
george (9:24:48 PM):  yea, every investment has drawbacks
amy (9:24:53 PM):  so is money  -->  madoff    lol
george (9:25:02 PM):  nothing is 100% certain
george (9:26:32 PM):  lol, might be time to change topic
amy (9:26:46 PM):  thats right-  i never would have thought....
george (9:26:50 PM):  feels like storm clouds in this channel
rachael (9:26:55 PM):  I guess that should have been a tipoff for Madoff's investors - he told them it was certain.
amy (9:27:11 PM):  coming out of undergrad 10 yrs ago that i would be experiencing these issues firsthand
george (9:27:52 PM):  yup, you're seeing it happen before your eyes in slow motion
amy (9:27:56 PM):  we've come to think that each generation is supposed to do better than the previous...
rachael (9:28:40 PM):  I don't think that's true anymore.
amy (9:28:49 PM):  nope
amy (9:29:09 PM):  i might be the last in my family....hopefully hopefully not though!
george (9:29:33 PM):  is your clock ticking loudly?
amy (9:29:43 PM):  hahaha  which clock?
george (9:29:44 PM):  i only have one living relative
george (9:29:58 PM):  biological clock!
amy (9:30:42 PM):  no, its not actually ticking loudly but i just would hate to think my parents are worried about me-  they are retired and have been lucky to live a comfortable life so far
george (9:31:55 PM):  are you two in albany?
amy (9:32:19 PM):  just outside
amy (9:32:31 PM):  saratoga bordering albany  cty
rachael (9:32:41 PM):  50 miles south.
george (9:32:44 PM):  ah
amy (9:32:57 PM):  grew up in alb cty though
amy (9:33:08 PM):  county-  not city just to clarify
rachael (9:33:19 PM):  I have two children, and I'd like to think they'll have a nice life!
george (9:33:56 PM):  yea hopefully we get through this mess in a few years
amy (9:33:58 PM):  i think they are the ones who will hlp turn this country around and back on the right track for many yrs to come
rachael (9:34:22 PM):  Do you think that will happen, that we'll get through this mess?
amy (9:34:39 PM):  us seems to need a wakeup call, as much as i love it and everything here
amy (9:34:53 PM):  Yes!
george (9:35:13 PM):  it's hard to say what is going to happen if we go into a depression
amy (9:35:42 PM):  but george, if that happens, i think it is part of the wake up call, not that we want that to happen of course
amy (9:36:03 PM):  but it will help americans learn the value of a dollar again and to relearn basic practices
george (9:36:19 PM):  we dont' want it to happen but you might be right...it could be the necessary corrections
amy (9:36:21 PM):  it has been lost somewhere along the way
george (9:36:47 PM):  another bad indicator is "quantitative easing"
rachael (9:36:50 PM):  But it's hard to learn the value of a dollar when that value keeps changing.
amy (9:37:00 PM):  you are justfull of surprises george-  what is that?
rachael (9:37:08 PM):  Wait!  What's quantitative easing?
amy (9:37:09 PM):  hahaha rachael good point
george (9:37:39 PM):  french revolution, bolshevik revolution...
amy (9:37:46 PM):  what  meant  the value is hard work, good values in dealing with others, and less greed
rachael (9:38:26 PM):  What do those revolutions have to do with quantitative easing?  I don't know what it means.
george (9:39:30 PM):  they started using "quantitative easing" shortly before these things happened...i'm trying to think of a third example
george (9:40:05 PM):  but they're doing that now in the US, and started it in UK as well
george (9:40:31 PM):  btw, UK is pretty screwed
george (9:41:04 PM):  we might be following in their footsteps tho
rachael (9:41:14 PM):  But what's quantitative easing?  Are you going to force me to Google!??
amy (9:41:20 PM):  hehe
george (9:41:51 PM):  it's where they are buying debt and creating money out of thin air
george (9:42:03 PM):  there's a nice article in wikipedia
rachael (9:42:08 PM):  How do you buy debt?
amy (9:42:11 PM):  we covered that i think
george (9:42:17 PM):  can't seem to paste in here tonight for some reason :( :( :(
rachael (9:42:35 PM):  Is the article in Wikipedia titled quantitative easing?
rachael (9:42:53 PM):  You're right; we did talk about buying debt.
george (9:42:56 PM):  quantitative easing, yes
amy (9:43:03 PM):  oh wikipedia might not be the right place to search rachael
rachael (9:43:30 PM):  I always start there, just for the sources at the bottom of the page.
amy (9:43:45 PM):  oh i see-  good idea
george (9:43:52 PM):  yea, i got it open, go to the risk section and read that
rachael (9:44:07 PM):  OK
george (9:44:43 PM):  there's "toxic assets" floating around, failed mortgage backed securities and derivatives
george (9:45:05 PM):  they are losing value and defaulting
george (9:45:33 PM):  fed: we're going to start buying these toxic assets...you're welcome, citizens of the US!!!
amy (9:46:31 PM):  ae you two participating tomorrow afternoons chat?
george (9:46:50 PM):  i'm not positive
rachael (9:46:55 PM):  No, I'm not back on until Sunday.
george (9:47:04 PM):  probably
amy (9:47:08 PM):  ok  i'll be here sunday too
amy (9:47:25 PM):  how do we go about choosing topics-  is it predetermined?
george (9:47:41 PM):  i chose :P
amy (9:47:50 PM):  yes and we  thank you for that
amy (9:47:53 PM):  :)
rachael (9:47:58 PM):  Oh, thanks!
amy (9:48:08 PM):  ive learned that  have a great deal to learn about economics!   lol
rachael (9:48:16 PM):  Really, I found it interesting.
amy (9:48:22 PM):  i agree
george (9:48:35 PM):  ohh i thought that was sarcasm!
amy (9:48:53 PM):  no sarcasm from me-  just a little lighthumor
george (9:49:05 PM):  lol
rachael (9:49:09 PM):  It was, but truthfully it was a good discussion.
amy (9:49:16 PM):  i am now more informed which is why its always good to talk to people and learn thatyou mayhave more to learn
george (9:49:44 PM):  (less than sign)--
george (9:49:56 PM):  doh, greater than sign still don't work
george (9:50:04 PM):  er less than sign
amy (9:50:36 PM):  > is greaer than
george (9:50:36 PM):  i like to emote using less than sign and --
george (9:50:45 PM):  (-- hungry like that
amy (9:50:59 PM):  emote?
amy (9:51:05 PM):  oh like emotions?
george (9:51:07 PM):  yup, --> is an arrow...i can't make one pointing to the left to point to my name
george (9:51:40 PM):  yup, emote like :) :(
amy (9:51:49 PM):  gotcha
george (9:51:58 PM):  >8-/
amy (9:52:10 PM):  :P
amy (9:52:27 PM):  i only know the simple ones
amy (9:52:52 PM):  have we exhausted our topic on thatnote?
george (9:52:53 PM):  but yea, look up peter schiff on youtube..he's a good start to learn about our economic disaster
rachael (9:52:54 PM):  What is >8-/?
amy (9:53:09 PM):  i def will just to see what he's all about
amy (9:53:15 PM):  a little guy
rachael (9:53:15 PM):  I think I'll review Ron Paul
george (9:53:18 PM):  that's a stern face
rachael (9:53:35 PM):  Ron Paul? Stern face?
george (9:53:43 PM):  yes ron paul has the right idea
george (9:54:15 PM):  but nobody listens to him...they think he's a moonbat but he's probably the only strict constatutionalist
amy (9:54:17 PM):  oh i think online chatting is funny sometimes - i just laughed at the last few lines
rachael (9:54:50 PM):  He's an intelligent man.
amy (9:55:09 PM):  ron paul?
george (9:55:37 PM):  yup, ron paul
rachael (9:55:38 PM):  Yes, I think so.  I didn't vote for him, however.
george (9:56:48 PM):  T_T
amy (9:57:15 PM):  ?
rachael (9:57:24 PM):  Good Night!
george (9:57:24 PM):  ok, i think it's time to get a little more programming done and hit the sack
george (9:57:33 PM):  nice talking to you ladies!

george (8:41:37 PM):  hi everybody, it's me from 5 minutes ago!  is everybody enjoying the new world?
vincent (8:41:49 PM):  Yeah, it was weird mara.
vincent (8:42:19 PM):  have people already signed out and back in?
rachael (8:42:23 PM):  I am so confused.  The me of three minutes ago is missing.
mara (8:42:30 PM):  ok everyone should sign out and back in.. thats what we had to do last time this happened
michelle (8:42:34 PM):  yes, I did once, vincent
mara (8:42:36 PM):  i can see everything, but still
vincent (8:42:42 PM):  I'm travel crazy.  leaving home again in about a week.
vincent (8:42:48 PM):  george, the future is awesome.
vincent (8:43:06 PM):  and it's still weird, michelle?
rachael (8:43:08 PM):  It seems so much like the past, though.
mara (8:43:17 PM):  we did the travel thing once already
vincent (8:43:26 PM):  yeah, but cars are more round in the future.
michelle (8:43:43 PM):  now it is fine, vincent

george (8:47:10 PM):  rachael- silver is declining in supply
michelle (8:47:19 PM):  where is the chatroom list?
vincent (8:47:43 PM):  the chat has become its own topic now
george (8:47:51 PM):  and should silver become our effective currency, it will be easier to use than gold
vincent (8:47:53 PM):  the system itself... it's meta
michelle (8:47:59 PM):  a little distracting
rachael (8:48:10 PM):  Silver was ten minutes ago.  Maybe things have changed?
vincent (8:48:20 PM):  rachael, how long ago did you ask me if I was going on tour?
michelle (8:48:35 PM):  george, which topic was this? travel or silver?
rachael (8:48:58 PM):  At 8:49:06, vincent.
michelle (8:49:04 PM):  hi, hi, what can we do nw?
vincent (8:49:16 PM):  Oh, not bad.  I got it t 5:51... I mean 8:51 for you guys.
george (8:49:34 PM):  someone said topic = money
vincent (8:49:40 PM):  yeah, going on tour in Europe starting next week, but not with Dead Science.  a band called Casiotone For The Painfully Alone.
vincent (8:49:55 PM):  friends that I play drums for when I can.
rachael (8:50:08 PM):  I can't decide whether I like the silver topic or the meta-chat topic better.
vincent (8:50:41 PM):  let's chat about meta-chat... double meta!
michelle (8:51:26 PM):  fine with me, vincent
george (8:51:44 PM):  vincent, your response to my "compare with timestamp" was 13 min after i typed it
vincent (8:51:55 PM):  no way!!!!!!!!!
rachael (8:52:01 PM):  This is a little Lost-ish.
michelle (8:52:17 PM):  lost....
vincent (8:52:24 PM):  I should send you stock tips and sports stats from the future... like Biff.
michelle (8:52:48 PM):  vincent, stock tips are interesting.
vincent (8:53:01 PM):  I wonder if the characters on Lost have seen Back To The Future?
rachael (8:53:30 PM):  No stock tips,please.  Too late.
vincent (8:53:54 PM):  shit, this is psycho.
michelle (8:54:09 PM):  hi, everyone. disappeared again?
george (8:54:15 PM):  i logged back in
michelle (8:54:54 PM):  where r u guys?
michelle (8:55:12 PM):  I feel a bit nervous using this chat now.
michelle (8:55:51 PM):  hi there
michelle (8:55:57 PM):  still nobody there?
michelle (8:56:04 PM):  hihi, please
michelle (8:56:08 PM):  anyone?
george (8:56:10 PM):  <b>hi</b>
michelle (8:56:21 PM):  should I log out again and reenter?
michelle (8:56:28 PM):  hihihihihi
rachael (8:56:30 PM):  I mean it's too late for the stock market; it closed at 4 or 4:30.
vincent (8:57:06 PM):  a song just came on my itunes on random where a dude just yelled "the future was in the past!"  ... it's a clue to this chat
george (8:57:53 PM):  what's this about the stock market, rachael?  :o
vincent (8:57:59 PM):  wow, we're just a third of the way into this.
rachael (8:58:13 PM):  michelle, we're here.  This is sort of like science fiction.
michelle (8:58:25 PM):  rachael, maybe we can use the tips for tomorrow.
michelle (8:58:27 PM):  :-)
vincent (8:58:35 PM):  don't get stocks!  that's my tip.
vincent (8:58:46 PM):  i'm here
rachael (8:58:57 PM):  vincent was going to give us stock tips from the future.
michelle (8:59:15 PM):  vincent, go ahead
george (8:59:16 PM):  lol
vincent (8:59:21 PM):  why nervous... time travel paradoxes?
vincent (8:59:33 PM):  michelle!  can you here me?!
rachael (8:59:34 PM):  michelle, you're back!
vincent (8:59:39 PM):  hear
michelle (8:59:57 PM):  Yes, I hear you, vincent
vincent (9:00:05 PM):  i was talking about time travel, and send back stock tips
george (9:00:05 PM):  she took a time machine
michelle (9:00:18 PM):  I like it, time travel paradoxes
vincent (9:00:29 PM):  AIG!  it's the only way to go.
george (9:00:40 PM):  funny...i was just talking about time travel today
michelle (9:00:50 PM):  It is like in a dark room, then suddenly nobody is there
vincent (9:01:02 PM):  are you a Lost watcher, george?
george (9:01:17 PM):  nope, never seen that
michelle (9:01:22 PM):  vincent, do you mean we sould buy AIG?
rachael (9:01:34 PM):  mara, meg, amy, are you still here?
vincent (9:01:36 PM):  they're getting into some heavy time-travel paradox territory on that show now.
vincent (9:01:43 PM):  no, just joking about AIG.
michelle (9:02:01 PM):  good to know. ...
george (9:02:21 PM):  time travel is so troubled i don't know why they use it in stories anymore :P
george (9:02:47 PM):  if you were to go back in time 1 min, would you displace yourself?
vincent (9:02:57 PM):  it's pretty tricky and fun in this context, this show.
george (9:03:06 PM):  or would you end up in space in the path earth is travelling?
rachael (9:03:08 PM):  I think we actually have gone back in time one minute.
vincent (9:03:26 PM):  I guess, one of us would have to fall out of my chair.
michelle (9:03:26 PM):  the user list is gone again.
george (9:03:30 PM):  either way, i doubt it would be fun!
vincent (9:03:57 PM):  or yeah!  be just a little bit to the right of me (east is to my right, right now)
vincent (9:04:17 PM):  no!  i mean left!
george (9:05:10 PM):  there would still be air and other matter in the space you are trying to occupy!
rachael (9:05:24 PM):  I see ariel logged on.  I wonder if she's caught in a warp in the time-space continuum.
vincent (9:05:51 PM):  the air would just push out my door, as if another person walked in.
george (9:05:56 PM):  hi ariel
michelle (9:06:08 PM):  Hi ariel
vincent (9:06:22 PM):  whoa, ariel, you picked a crazy time to come.  the chat system has been kind of haywire.
george (9:06:32 PM):  ok, then after 1 min, the next you would go back in time and displace your first self!
vincent (9:07:06 PM):  the original me would yell, move!  before the third one showed up.  then I would run out of the room and go crazy.
george (9:07:21 PM):  lol
george (9:08:14 PM):  well, it looks like the lag is down to the point where we can communicate without the time machine
vincent (9:08:31 PM):  cool.
george (9:08:55 PM):  well, for the 2 of us at least...i don't know what the girls are doing
vincent (9:09:40 PM):  yeah,  well, what next?
michelle (9:10:30 PM):  pick a topic to discuss? how about the auto industry bail out. it is all over the news.
vincent (9:10:36 PM):  do you know anything about what happens after tonight, with this study?
vincent (9:10:48 PM):  they say this is the end of the "first session"
george (9:10:53 PM):  auto industry bailout is more fail!
george (9:11:09 PM):  yea i think there's going to be another round of chat
vincent (9:11:23 PM):  the decision to not bail out?  or the original idea of the bailout?
michelle (9:11:50 PM):  the decision to not bail out
rachael (9:11:54 PM):  This is spooky.  Do we know if amy, mara, meg, and ariel are still here?
george (9:12:03 PM):  well...
vincent (9:12:24 PM):  haven't heard from them in a bit.
george (9:12:43 PM):  i think the government should let the market work...we need deflation, we need to pay back our debt, we need to save and not spend as much
vincent (9:13:16 PM):  hm.  it seems to me like the unregulated market has been the cause of lots of this?
michelle (9:13:21 PM):  i agree with you george.  but it seems the idea of  "too big to fail" is floating around
george (9:13:24 PM):  government should cut spending, bring back troops and close foreign bases, and raise interest rates
rachael (9:13:32 PM):  george, the unregulated market hasn't worked all that well.
george (9:13:50 PM):  the fed setting interest rates unnaturrally low caused this
michelle (9:14:08 PM):  the market in broad sense, i think, would work. but the financial market is a mess
george (9:14:13 PM):  cheap money, cheap credit, subprime loans
vincent (9:14:36 PM):  but also business leaders taking advantage of the low regulations...
george (9:14:47 PM):  government regulates businesses here, taxes them to the point where they move to cheaper labor
rachael (9:14:50 PM):  And right now nobody can spend except the govt.  I want them to spend more - maybe revuild some bridges? (I mean actual, not figurative, bridges.)
michelle (9:15:27 PM):  that maybe the purpose of the stimulus package? get more infrastructure
george (9:15:32 PM):  rachael- problem is the fed is broke.  they can't fund those projects
george (9:15:51 PM):  they borrow money from chinese via treasury bonds
vincent (9:16:00 PM):  right, that's tricky, where the money comes from
rachael (9:16:01 PM):  I mean we need regulations for the businesses that produce nothing but change one financial instrument into another.
george (9:16:14 PM):  china and russia started the ball rolling on replacing the dollar as the world reserve currency
michelle (9:16:16 PM):  the fed seems to be ready to print more money. that worries me
michelle (9:16:33 PM):  that won't be pretty
michelle (9:17:06 PM):  but i don't think it is feasible to replace US dollar with some world currency
george (9:17:08 PM):  on top of our constant borrowing (remember madoff's business), we have a trade deficit compounding the problem
michelle (9:17:10 PM):  at least won't work for now
george (9:17:53 PM):  i've seen an estimate that the "toxic" derivatives floating around the world amounted approximately 1.2 quadrillion
vincent (9:18:10 PM):  that's crazy.
george (9:18:17 PM):  it's down to about half that, but the world's GDP is about 50 trillion
george (9:18:21 PM):  can expect lots more deflation
michelle (9:18:24 PM):  yeah
rachael (9:18:31 PM):  What does "toxic" mean when people talk about toxic assets?
george (9:18:58 PM):  it means there's debt that can't be paid
george (9:19:20 PM):  overpriced, backed by nothing
rachael (9:19:41 PM):  So how can toxic assets be gotten off a bank's books?  Who would buy them?
george (9:19:59 PM):  they sign them off as losses
michelle (9:20:05 PM):  try to attract private money with some backup from the government
george (9:20:17 PM):  well, that would be the honest thing to do, but they like to sell them back and forth between each other
rachael (9:20:54 PM):  Is it possible that amy, mara, meg, and ariel are having an entirely different conversation???
vincent (9:21:05 PM):  weird.
michelle (9:21:10 PM):  that would be interesting. does the system allow that?
vincent (9:21:15 PM):  about the exact same thing???!
rachael (9:21:28 PM):  As I said, spooky.
george (9:21:35 PM):  lol
george (9:21:46 PM):  *twilight zone music*
vincent (9:21:51 PM):  this whole thing is really just a study in alternate timelines.... has nothing to do with "chat"
rachael (9:22:28 PM):  That's right.  We all fell for that "chat" story.
vincent (9:22:48 PM):  oh, hey, meg!  yes I hear you.
vincent (9:22:52 PM):  welcome back!
vincent (9:23:03 PM):  totally.
vincent (9:23:06 PM):  weird.
rachael (9:23:13 PM):  I don't hear meg!
george (9:23:20 PM):  it's a human study on how people cope with alternate realities and time pockets
vincent (9:23:26 PM):  I was just kidding.
michelle (9:23:49 PM):  me either. did not see anything from meg
vincent (9:23:58 PM):  I was joking!  sorry!
george (9:24:15 PM):  she has found a way of only speaking to vincent
vincent (9:24:20 PM):  meg didn't come back.
george (9:24:46 PM):  now he's trying to cover for her!
vincent (9:24:56 PM):  I swear!
rachael (9:24:57 PM):  But she still is shown signed in, so where are meg and the others?
michelle (9:25:07 PM):  lol. admit it, vincent
vincent (9:25:09 PM):  meg, shhhhh.
george (9:25:40 PM):  *pokes meg*
vincent (9:26:34 PM):  I did that the other day, I got signed out and couldn't get back in, and moderator said I was still shown to be signed-in.
vincent (9:26:46 PM):  so they're probably gone, and stuck out there.
rachael (9:27:04 PM):  In which dimension, do you think?
vincent (9:27:13 PM):  X, probably?
vincent (9:27:21 PM):  it's a classic choice
vincent (9:27:30 PM):  or the 5th.
george (9:28:04 PM):  is that where the romulans come from?
vincent (9:28:21 PM):  knowing them... probably.
vincent (9:29:03 PM):  one sec, guys, brb
george (9:29:33 PM):  link
george (9:29:44 PM):  this guy gives the best advice.
vincent (9:30:12 PM):  I"m back.
vincent (9:30:43 PM):  always the best advice.
george (9:30:58 PM):  woah i moused over my own link a few times and i got 10 videos popping up
vincent (9:31:04 PM):  now have we lost rachael and michelle?
george (9:31:06 PM):  echo effect
vincent (9:31:26 PM):  that's how that works.  i was wondering why I got like 100 cute overload windows yesterday.
george (9:31:26 PM):  *shrug*
rachael (9:31:34 PM):  No, I was lost briefly with Mr, T., but came back.  Where's michelle?
michelle (9:32:09 PM):  hi, I am back here
vincent (9:32:19 PM):  hey!
vincent (9:32:27 PM):  this is the weirdest chat.
michelle (9:32:38 PM):  I agree
rachael (9:32:48 PM):  True.
george (9:32:51 PM):  missing ariel, meg, amy, huh
rachael (9:33:07 PM):  Dimension X.
vincent (9:33:08 PM):  yeah, they disappeared!
rachael (9:33:15 PM):  Or alternate universe.
vincent (9:33:23 PM):  ooh, just got an email from moderator.  hold on!
michelle (9:33:47 PM):  o.k. what did she say?
vincent (9:34:07 PM):  Extremely sorry about today's session. I was having technical difficulties myself with the server and the network here at home. Very sorry but due to network problems could not email you ahead of time. I rushed to the office, but it is obviously too late.Thanks a lot to everyone for trying for so long!!We did manage to capture a lot of your interactions, before the difficulties,however, we need to schedule one more of these.Some of you indicated that tomorrow night might work for you, so I will email you accordingly tomorrow.
vincent (9:34:47 PM):  that's copied from her, not me
rachael (9:34:52 PM):  She's sticking to the "this is about chat" storyline!
vincent (9:35:06 PM):  ha!  likely story.
george (9:35:35 PM):  she's restored temporal regularity to our conversation and monitoring the after-effects
vincent (9:35:50 PM):  I'm getting a nosebleed!
george (9:36:08 PM):  i appear to have another limb!
rachael (9:36:17 PM):  If there really is a moderator; I think it's Hal.
vincent (9:36:18 PM):  ha
vincent (9:36:28 PM):  it is HAL!
vincent (9:36:40 PM):  "i can... feel it... i can... feel it"
rachael (9:37:29 PM):  Users list gone again.
george (9:37:45 PM):  ooh hi moderator!
vincent (9:37:47 PM):  do you know that the name HAL, each letter is just one letter back from IBM?
rachael (9:38:23 PM):  I wonder if that was intentional.  I also wonder who ...or what...moderator are.
vincent (9:38:33 PM):  alright!  ILS!  what do they have to say to you, george, the chosen one?
rachael (9:39:00 PM):  michelle, are you still here?
george (9:39:15 PM):  time for ascention is soon
vincent (9:39:15 PM):  have they given you their secrets?
michelle (9:39:18 PM):  yes, I am here
rachael (9:39:44 PM):  If we've been in two alternate realities, do we get paid double?
george (9:39:55 PM):  i thought all the secrets were exposed in hitchhiker's guilde
michelle (9:40:03 PM):  rachael, good idea
vincent (9:40:05 PM):  oh yeah, 42.
george (9:40:06 PM):  we should rachael!
rachael (9:40:35 PM):  42 what?
vincent (9:40:35 PM):  I sure hope we get paid for today and the extra session.
george (9:41:07 PM):  rachael, you should pick up a copy of hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
vincent (9:41:13 PM):  42, in the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy is the answer to "life, the universe, and everything"
rachael (9:41:19 PM):  OK.
michelle (9:41:27 PM):  got it, vincent
george (9:41:27 PM):  that's a good read
vincent (9:42:22 PM):  yeah, it's fun.  read it forever ago.
george (9:42:36 PM):  the thought of higher beings planting dinosaur bones just for us to discover cracks me up
vincent (9:42:47 PM):  I remember the universe's loudedst rock band, that you have to listen to from a nuclear blast shelter on another planet.
rachael (9:43:12 PM):  That would be Casiotone for the Painfully Alone.
vincent (9:43:21 PM):  ha.
vincent (9:43:37 PM):  good memory.
vincent (9:44:14 PM):  so, did moderator's thing sound like they gave up on this chat?
vincent (9:44:18 PM):  kind of?
vincent (9:44:34 PM):  I can't tell if we keep going or what.
rachael (9:44:40 PM):  Yes.
michelle (9:44:51 PM):  moderator mentioned about having logged some interactions. I think they can still use some of them
george (9:44:52 PM):  dunno
rachael (9:44:52 PM):  I mean, yes, I think she has given  up.
george (9:45:01 PM):  *pokes meg again*
vincent (9:45:03 PM):  should we go till 7, just so we get paid fully?
vincent (9:45:07 PM):  I mean 10pm.
michelle (9:45:19 PM):  I think we can stop right now if we don't have any other topic in mind
george (9:45:34 PM):  only 12 min left anyways
vincent (9:45:37 PM):  up to you guys.
michelle (9:45:40 PM):  what do you think?
rachael (9:45:43 PM):  Maybe meg and co. will turn up.
michelle (9:45:47 PM):  fine with me too.
vincent (9:45:59 PM):  I'll hang around.
vincent (9:46:27 PM):  let's do random word associations.  the word is:  Tartar
rachael (9:46:46 PM):  Sauce.
rachael (9:46:54 PM):  Cossack.
george (9:47:01 PM):  so a guy invents a machine that answers all yes/no questions 100% accurately.  a woman comes up and asks it "is the answer to the next question no?"
vincent (9:47:02 PM):  Sauce Sack
rachael (9:47:39 PM):  What's the solution?
george (9:47:42 PM):  ohh, i'll do associations too...tho i've never seen cossack :o
vincent (9:47:54 PM):  there isn't one, it's an antinomy.
george (9:47:57 PM):  the machine can't answer
vincent (9:48:02 PM):  is that the word?
george (9:48:15 PM):  paradox
vincent (9:48:27 PM):  there's a barber that shaves ALL and ONLY people who do not shave themselves... so does he shave himself?
rachael (9:48:37 PM):  Is antimony like silver?  We should invest?  And Cossacks were often Tatars,
vincent (9:48:54 PM):  cossack -  hammock
george (9:48:56 PM):  ahh i've seen that one...i have a problem with the barber paradox
michelle (9:48:58 PM):  interesting question
vincent (9:49:28 PM):  if he shaves himself, then he doesn't shave himself...  if he doesn't, then he does.
george (9:49:44 PM):  what if the barber does not grow facial hair?
vincent (9:49:46 PM):  hammock - haddock - hummus
george (9:49:48 PM):  :P
vincent (9:49:55 PM):  great!  it's sexist!
rachael (9:50:01 PM):  Whatif the barber is female?
vincent (9:50:01 PM):  you killed the paradox!
vincent (9:50:14 PM):  that's the real answer.
george (9:50:32 PM):  paradox killar #1!
rachael (9:50:44 PM):  I suddenly have, in blie, the start of the cn=onversation in paragraph form on my screen.
michelle (9:50:45 PM):  Yes rachael is smart
rachael (9:50:57 PM):  "blue.
vincent (9:50:59 PM):  I
vincent (9:51:09 PM):  I've had that before, it usually happens at the end
vincent (9:51:14 PM):  the paragraph thing
michelle (9:51:15 PM):  I don't
vincent (9:52:01 PM):  unless it's a barber that shaves armpits, etc.
rachael (9:52:29 PM):  You could restore the paradox that way.
vincent (9:52:47 PM):  i think it would be called something other than a barber?  groomer?
vincent (9:52:58 PM):  person hygeine manager?
vincent (9:53:02 PM):  personal
george (9:53:10 PM):  landscaper
vincent (9:53:16 PM):  ha
george (9:53:26 PM):  is there an official job for shaving armpits?
rachael (9:53:39 PM):  Slave.
george (9:53:49 PM):  what do you call the people who give brazilian waxes?
vincent (9:53:50 PM):  nice, rachael.  I heard about a barber that shaves legs.
george (9:54:05 PM):  lol
vincent (9:54:07 PM):  waxer, or like, is there a name for a spa worker?
george (9:54:24 PM):  yea spa something i bet
rachael (9:54:24 PM):  michelle, could you restore some dignity to this conversation?
vincent (9:54:42 PM):  yes, do.
michelle (9:54:57 PM):  hehehe
george (9:55:26 PM):  i think michelle is endorsing the topic with her laughter
michelle (9:55:30 PM):  maybe next time. we are almost done
vincent (9:55:32 PM):  I was hoping michelle would just slam down something totally juvenile right then.
rachael (9:55:44 PM):  Back to Planet Xargon.
michelle (9:56:03 PM):  oh.... some posts from 9pm
rachael (9:56:27 PM):  Good night!
vincent (9:56:33 PM):  we made it, guys.  well done.  see you sometime soon.  I guess mabye tomorrow.
michelle (9:56:43 PM):  good night.

julie (20:03:50 PM):  he was only in office for 9 months before he got the award
julie (20:04:17 PM):  he wasn't able to actually achieve anything important within that time
shania (20:04:29 PM):  exactly
julie (20:04:38 PM):  he had some great ideas though
vicky (20:04:43 PM):  I really liked the Time article about it though
vicky (20:04:45 PM):  "This prize, to a 48-year-old freshman president, for “extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,” seemed a kind of prayer and encouragement by the Nobel committee for future endeavor and more consensual American leadership."
vicky (20:05:04 PM):  I do think he was taking a step in the right direction
david (20:05:11 PM):  you have to look at the purpose of the award and this guy Mr. Nobel from Sweeden - his intention - i believe though, that the Nobel Peace prize came after other Nobel Prizes - and the criteria the committee considered for the winner
vicky (20:05:16 PM):  and the Nobel was a carrot on a stick to keep us moving in that direction
david (20:05:51 PM):  yes, but in that sense he deserves it - if you look at in the context of American leadership in the past decade -
shania (20:06:01 PM):  i feel as though it's been awarded prematurely
vicky (20:06:15 PM):  based on previous accomplishments, I would agree with you shania
vicky (20:06:27 PM):  I think he did some wonderful things opening up a dialogue with other countries
vicky (20:06:38 PM):  and that's definitely in line with the Peace Prize, but I don't know if it's enough
david (20:06:47 PM):  and how his administration signaled a change in tone -to more cooperative relations as opposed to unilateral
shania (20:06:49 PM):  he has instilled a renewed sense of hope in people around the world and that is wonderful
david (20:07:26 PM):  that's the entire purpose of the peace prize, so by your very statement - you paint a compelling argument as to why he deserves it
shania (20:07:29 PM):  yet i feel to deserve it there needs to be some tangible outcomes
shania (20:07:48 PM):  to his initiatives, i mean
david (20:07:48 PM):  What is a tangible outcome when we're talking about peace?
david (20:08:18 PM):  you also have to consider the other candidates - the competition - basically, the peace prize is based on influence
david (20:08:32 PM):  you cannot create peace and cooperation among people w/o influence - and
david (20:09:04 PM):  it is unlikely his competitors enjoyed the influence he did , and therefore they would be unable to match his efforts toward cooperation b/n people
julie (20:09:13 PM):  he's showing interest in peace, but at that point in time no particular accomplishments were made
shania (20:09:20 PM):  this is true david
julie (20:09:25 PM):  i feel like he deserved it but not at that point in time
macy (20:09:35 PM):  Hi, just arrived and will catch up by reading your posts now....
shania (20:09:51 PM):  i agree that he has a certain influence but what has come of his initiatives as of now?
vicky (20:10:06 PM):  I wonder if Nicolas Sarkozy would have made a better choice
shania (20:10:09 PM):  the article said that carter won in 1992, how many years after his presidency?
vicky (20:10:13 PM):  I was reading earlier about the Georgia/Russia conflict
vicky (20:10:16 PM):  and he mediated it
david (20:10:19 PM):  well - also - he did have accomplishments - i would assert that gaining the presidency is an accomplishment, especially representing such a historically disadvantaged group
david (20:10:54 PM):  he brought more people into the electorate than ever before
shania (20:11:02 PM):  he is an historical figure already and i feel as though he will do great things as a world leader but im not convinced
julie (20:11:14 PM):  if anything they are giving it to him because he is of a different race, and not on his character
vicky (20:11:18 PM):  I'm not sure his being voted president would count as promoting international communication/peace
vicky (20:11:34 PM):  I agree with the idea of looking for tangible results
macy (20:11:36 PM):  I do not believe he was ready to receive the peace prize
vicky (20:11:54 PM):  Nicolas Sarkozy - tangible result of helping mediate that conflict successfully
julie (20:11:54 PM):  agreed
david (20:11:55 PM):  well - whether he will do great things as a leader is not really relevant - unless you want to argue that the committee awarded him the prized based on expectation, which is not actually a bad addition to the argument for why he deserves it
vicky (20:12:07 PM):  Piedad Córdoba also helped successfully mediate a conflict
david (20:12:16 PM):  what did Sarkozy do?
vicky (20:12:21 PM):  (FARC and Hugo Chavez)
vicky (20:12:34 PM):  Sarkozy mediated the Russia/Georgia conflict
macy (20:12:40 PM):  isn't the prize supposed to be awarded to someone who has displayed action to warrant a change or effort to the world..
david (20:12:47 PM):  Sarkozy just has sex with countless young women - that's basically his accomplishment if you ask the French people - not very related to peace across people
shania (20:13:20 PM):  sex is someone's personal life, it does not impact the entire world or peace...
vicky (20:13:23 PM):  I don't think personal lives are really related to the prize
julie (20:13:37 PM):  i agree with shania
julie (20:13:48 PM):  and vicky
david (20:13:51 PM):  they are not - yet this his only accomplishment - what professional accomplishments of Sarkoxy can you site
david (20:13:56 PM):  Sarkozy *
vicky (20:14:02 PM):  I was just looking through 2009 conflicts
vicky (20:14:16 PM):  and that particular conflict seemed to actually have a resolution, which involved Sarkozy
shania (20:14:23 PM):  right, vicky
julie (20:14:23 PM):  he obviously made some contribution to be nominated
vicky (20:14:24 PM):  Obama has not yet been involved in any actual resolutions
david (20:14:54 PM):  okay - so Sarkozy "obviously" made some contributions to be nominated - and
shania (20:15:09 PM):  obama has started new talks between palestinians and isrealis but we have yet to see any real progress
david (20:15:11 PM):  we should just defer to the committee's judgement bc he was nominated? yet we can't trust their judgement on the person
david (20:15:19 PM):  they actually picked to win?
macy (20:15:22 PM):  i agree with laurens recommendation so far- actual resolution is key to the prize process
vicky (20:15:36 PM):  link
julie (20:15:39 PM):  yes it makes sense
vicky (20:15:51 PM):  It looks like he is trying to make steps in the Middle East too, although obviously that's not a quick resolution
david (20:15:59 PM):  okay, well there is no peace in the Middle East - so we can basically discount that wikipedia link
shania (20:16:00 PM):  of course it won't be
vicky (20:16:09 PM):  I'm not saying he should have had the peace prize necessarily
vicky (20:16:19 PM):  but just comparing Obama to someone else who seems to have more tangible results I think is useful
shania (20:16:26 PM):  definitely
david (20:17:03 PM):  and an actual resolution would include hope - you cannot devalue that - bc it is incredibly important - he definitely mobilized a segment of the population that were incredibly marginalized in the political process
shania (20:17:11 PM):  those who have won in the past like nelson mandela have truly made peace and equality a reality for many and deserve to have won it
shania (20:17:21 PM):  hope is key, david, this is true
david (20:17:29 PM):  I don't think Sarkozy measures up - basically i disagree there
macy (20:17:31 PM):  david, you mentioned earlier how the administration set a different tone, is there anyone from that administration other than Obama you place in this category of deserviing the prize?
vicky (20:18:21 PM):  the US administration, macy?
david (20:18:22 PM):  well - it's not really whether they should receive the prize, the idea of this chat focuses on Obama - i don't want to stray from the topic too much - but -, i wouly say proly not to answer your question directly
vicky (20:18:47 PM):  I don't think it strays from the topic, david
vicky (20:19:00 PM):  Obama winning the prize is based on him deserving it more than anyone else in the world for 2009
vicky (20:19:08 PM):  so we have to look at other people with international accomplishments
macy (20:19:31 PM):  oh the way i saw the topic, was if we were in agreement that obama did not deserve, then we need to choose someone else that is. So, i guess i was just seeing if you had any suggeestions since some of us arent going the obama way. Not that you need to change your mind, just to get some ideas thrown around.... :)
david (20:20:02 PM):  - well - basically - even more than achievements in science and medicine and other categories, influence is very crucial to the Nobel Peace Prize - if you do not have influence, you can not be considered -
vicky (20:20:04 PM):  Oh, you're right macy
macy (20:20:08 PM):  hen do you think that he may be eligible in the future and who would you pick to win this time.
vicky (20:20:13 PM):  if we decide Obama didn't deserve it, we do pick someone else
macy (20:20:35 PM):  right- influence seems to be key, i agree
shania (20:20:41 PM):  oh of course
macy (20:20:55 PM):  i would say obama is ABSOUTELY on the track to win for the future
shania (20:20:58 PM):  being influential is key to success in promoting anything, let alone peace
david (20:20:59 PM):  so this leaves a very small pool of eligible applicants
shania (20:21:07 PM):  yes, david
julie (20:21:28 PM):  true
david (20:21:39 PM):  and out of that handful of people, it should go to Obama - i mean who else can you think of ?
macy (20:22:01 PM):  i was looking at the list of past winners
shania (20:22:16 PM):  and i'm sorry to say i'm not knowledgeable enough about the other possibilities
macy (20:22:27 PM):  and honestly i have not heard of many, many of them. so that makes me feel i am a little out of the loop regarding important news in todays world
shania (20:22:42 PM):  haha, me too, macy!
macy (20:22:51 PM):  so...there must be people out there we do not know about who are desrving.
david (20:22:53 PM):  i wouldn't worry about it - you shouldn't fret, haha
vicky (20:23:27 PM):  we all seem to be typical Americans, pretty uninvolved with international news
david (20:23:29 PM):  i'm just making a joke - i'd be surprised if we could come up with more than a couple people between all of us
julie (20:23:36 PM):  i know i am
vicky (20:23:36 PM):  ... guess that leaves us out of being nominated :x
macy (20:23:49 PM):  who was talking about science and medicine before? that was a great track!
david (20:23:57 PM):  : :-)
macy (20:23:57 PM):  hahahah vicky
vicky (20:24:24 PM):  Aren't there separate prizes for science?
shania (20:24:28 PM):  i think so
vicky (20:24:33 PM):  I think the peace prize is really about international cooperation/peace
macy (20:24:37 PM):  i was thinking earlier about princess diana and her humanitraian efforts but i know that the deceased are not eligible....
vicky (20:24:43 PM):  Does anyone have a link for the previous winners?
david (20:24:46 PM):  yeah, those are separate i think
macy (20:24:48 PM):  is there someone who picked up where she left off??
david (20:24:52 PM):  we can just google it
vicky (20:25:01 PM):  it would have to be for 2009, macy
shania (20:25:11 PM):  apparently pete seeger was nominate!
shania (20:25:17 PM):  *nominated
macy (20:25:24 PM):  link
macy (20:25:44 PM):  right- anyone in 2009 that was in the news for humanitraian relief internationally like she was?
david (20:25:53 PM):  the problem with seeger - is that although i may like him some and know some about his music, he didn't relate to a big enough cross-section of the population
shania (20:26:18 PM):  oh definitely not david
julie (20:26:26 PM):  i agree
david (20:26:31 PM):  yeah - i'd say Diana would be a good pick
macy (20:26:56 PM):  i know her son does work like her....but there must be someone else who has been around doing this for longer and has more influence
macy (20:27:27 PM):  oooh what about current energy or conservation efforts? don henley hehehe
david (20:27:29 PM):  not her son - nobody really relates to him
julie (20:27:34 PM):  red cross... again
shania (20:28:08 PM):  this is really tough... even though i don't agree wth obama receiving it, it's so difficult to think of someone as well known as him
macy (20:28:15 PM):  i can only think of americans- i'm really bad at this-- there are certainly international people
david (20:28:45 PM):  i'd say he deserves it - there's definitely no other American more deserving , that's even easier to conclude i think
shania (20:28:51 PM):  nope!
vicky (20:29:00 PM):  I was really impressed by Sima Samar
vicky (20:29:05 PM):  link
david (20:29:14 PM):  so shania, you really think there were more deserving Americans?
macy (20:29:14 PM):  why does need to be american??
david (20:29:26 PM):  they don't
julie (20:29:41 PM):  i think were a lil bias
vicky (20:29:43 PM):  not so much for 2009, but for her lifetime achievements
shania (20:29:47 PM):  i don't think there were, david
david (20:30:10 PM):  yeah, we agree on that - that's good shania :-)
shania (20:30:43 PM):  americans are so self-involved most of the time... that doesnt lead to world peace!
macy (20:31:16 PM):  what are the criteria for being nominated? i cant find it yet
shania (20:31:18 PM):  its a shame that deceased people do not qualify
david (20:31:24 PM):  see - with Sima Samar -
david (20:31:36 PM):  basically she's very deserving of some prize - but i think her focus is too narrow
vicky (20:31:57 PM):  I would agree if it weren't for where she is located
vicky (20:32:13 PM):  Afghanistan is a microcosm of politics right now, and social improvements there would have a ripple effect
vicky (20:32:21 PM):  (hopefully)
vicky (20:32:40 PM):  I like the idea of grassroots, too
shania (20:32:46 PM):  what was the Iranian journalist's name who was killed not long ago?
vicky (20:33:57 PM):  Omid Reza Mir Sayafi?
vicky (20:34:02 PM):  link
david (20:34:04 PM):  yes - and the U.S. still creates a model that many struggling nations emulate, the U.S. still has influence, albeit it waning and declining - so to elect to an individual of African heritage, perhaps the most demonized and disadvantaged group in our national history, was really encouraging to the rest of the world - creating an incredible ripple effect
vicky (20:34:42 PM):  good argument david
shania (20:34:46 PM):  I'm thinking of a woman, she was quite an activist as well
shania (20:35:01 PM):  i'm trying to search google but can't find anything
vicky (20:35:05 PM):  oh wait
vicky (20:35:13 PM):  I think there was a woman who was... Egyptian?
vicky (20:35:18 PM):  I may be getting mixed up
shania (20:35:29 PM):  perhaps... i'll keep loking
shania (20:35:33 PM):  loking, rather
shania (20:35:36 PM):  or not
david (20:36:33 PM):  unfortunately - it's difficult for women to receive the peace prize - bc of sexism, they are still not as influential as men on the international scale, which is different than the domestic scale
macy (20:36:59 PM):  wow- gandhi was never awarded, but nominated 12 times i just read
shania (20:37:06 PM):  that's truly unfortunate, as women account for over half of the world's population!
vicky (20:37:06 PM):  I saw that earlier!
vicky (20:37:15 PM):  the year he was assassinated, they chose not to give it to anyone
david (20:37:21 PM):  a head of a major state is a good prerequisite for the prize, but i'm sure maybe even most of the winners were not in this category - i don't really know
macy (20:37:22 PM):  i still dont know who to "nominate" bc i dont know what the person needs to have done or when
shania (20:37:26 PM):  very interesting
macy (20:37:52 PM):  do they need to have done sth of sigificance in the year it is being awarded?
david (20:38:15 PM):  i could just find the criteria for the sweedish committee, but i'm kind of lazy
macy (20:38:17 PM):  bc otherwise there must be so nany to choose from (whom we do not know yet) who has been working toward peace efforts for a period of time
vicky (20:38:33 PM):  it is supposed to be something from 2009
macy (20:38:37 PM):  ah
macy (20:38:40 PM):  i
vicky (20:38:46 PM):  although a lifetime of achievement seems to be there for many of these people too
vicky (20:38:50 PM):  Gore - eh, not so much
macy (20:39:02 PM):  i'm going to google 2009 current events with key words Lol
macy (20:39:13 PM):  like humanitarianism
david (20:39:14 PM):  its a period of time i think - its proly not awarded annually, maybe every four years
david (20:39:20 PM):  gore was definitely deserving i'd say
julie (20:39:28 PM):  are we all in agreement that obama did not deserve the peace prize before we get into deciding who does?
macy (20:39:39 PM):  ahh good question
david (20:39:42 PM):  it's too unrealistic to award it each year
macy (20:39:47 PM):  i do not find obama deserving (yet)
david (20:39:50 PM):  nah, i think he deserves it
julie (20:40:07 PM):  i believe it does not deserve it yet as well
david (20:40:10 PM):  basically - i concur with the sweedish committee - but not with anyone here apparently
vicky (20:40:14 PM):  haha
macy (20:40:17 PM):  sorry david :)
julie (20:40:27 PM):  sorry
vicky (20:40:31 PM):  I was against Obama winning it before
vicky (20:40:44 PM):  and still lean towards that, but undecided
shania (20:40:46 PM):  i was VERY surprised when i found out he had won
david (20:40:48 PM):  it's okay - i'm not crushed, haha - the issue of course, is that we don't really get to decide - although it's kind of a fun exercicse
vicky (20:40:49 PM):  so was I
macy (20:40:58 PM):  shania- me too.. and to boot, he was surprised too!
david (20:41:11 PM):  he was humbled for sure
shania (20:41:15 PM):  i know! his statement is great
macy (20:41:16 PM):  agreed- sorta fun and challenging which is cool
julie (20:41:34 PM):  yes, even he himself didnt believe he deserved it
david (20:41:34 PM):  he can't exactly go out there and be like "yeah, of course it's me - i run things, etc."
david (20:41:44 PM):  he was truly humbled and should be i think
vicky (20:43:07 PM):  question david
vicky (20:43:22 PM):  you're pro-Obama in this debate and have mostly cited the fact that he was elected
david (20:43:41 PM):  it looks like it's an annual prize, i have to eat my words on that - i was too lazy to check it up
vicky (20:43:43 PM):  is that your primary reason for thinking he deserves the prize?
vicky (20:43:56 PM):  or also because of his outreach to open international talks
julie (20:44:07 PM):  good point
david (20:44:18 PM):  vicky, i wouldn't make it into a pro or anti-Obama - remember, we're not trying to politicize this
david (20:44:31 PM):  if you'd like to see my reason, please scroll backward on the chat transcript
vicky (20:44:36 PM):  I did specify in this debate
macy (20:45:05 PM):  it is yearly and can be awarded not only to indivudals but groups also
vicky (20:45:05 PM):  I wasn't sure from what you'd said previously
vicky (20:45:18 PM):  and was wondering which was more important in your decision-making
david (20:45:21 PM):  i hadn't signed in yet, my apologies
david (20:45:47 PM):  yeah, a lot of years it is shared - which is often the case for other categories of the award
david (20:46:33 PM):  so - if he really doesn't deserve it - why do you think it was awarded to him? bc they don't have to bow to the U.S., that's for sure - i suppose this question strays from the topic, but to a certain extent i defer to their judgement and expertise
david (20:46:44 PM):  wondering which of what?
vicky (20:47:24 PM):  a) that he was elected (which is historically significant and awesome) or b) his engagement with the international community
macy (20:47:38 PM):  david- my view on it is for "hope" and a "possibility for big change"
macy (20:47:52 PM):  which are great reasons
shania (20:48:01 PM):  i think the fact that he was elected, has opened up avenues for peace talks to begin, has initiated many bills (like for healthcare) in the US, and that he instilled hope in a population that was waning before he cam einto office all contributed
julie (20:48:31 PM):  i believe his presidency has effected the world tremendously, in social issues, but i believe the peace prize could have had a better candidate. who i am not sure. he has had a lot of great ideas about how to regulate and achieve peace. but at that point in time no progress was made. there has to be someone in the world who made more achievements then the few hopes obama had
shania (20:48:48 PM):  he truly is a magnanimous figure in the world, he himself gives peoplehope
macy (20:48:51 PM):  what about nelson mandela (i'm drifting from the current chat)
david (20:48:52 PM):  oh, i'd say both actually - bc his engagement with the international community is very well documented - for example, his speech in Berlin had the most powerful nation in the EU believing they had an ally in the U.S. - and his gestures to the Muslim would could arguably had an impact on potential young Musliim fundamentalists -
david (20:49:24 PM):  extending the olive branch to this group, instead of ostracizing them really could have had profound impact on the overall stability of that volatile area
vicky (20:49:28 PM):  the talking tour he did was amazing
vicky (20:49:35 PM):  I think that's probably the reason he won
vicky (20:49:46 PM):  I come back to the tangibility argument we had earlier
vicky (20:50:01 PM):  but like you said - how do you quantify peace?
vicky (20:50:04 PM):  or hope?
vicky (20:50:13 PM):  (you = david)
shania (20:50:22 PM):  exactly, it's really difficult to gauge these things
david (20:50:35 PM):  so basically - you think that his speeches was just "talking" and that he pulled the wool over the eyes of this distinguished Swedish panel, but that you're too smart for that?
vicky (20:50:44 PM):  haha
shania (20:51:19 PM):  however, i think that just the reactions to obama being elected seen around the world at the time were quite touching and did mark a new era in hope
vicky (20:51:19 PM):  not in those terms, that's a bit silly
david (20:51:25 PM):  well, when it comes down to it - i just think they know that they're doing and i'd trust them more than the average person i find on the street, including myself
macy (20:51:51 PM):  i believe in obama and believe the committee was justified in their choosing- since they chose him as a group- but i believe they placed an amount of pressure on someone who just arrived into the public spotlight
macy (20:52:08 PM):  without having had the change to place words into action
vicky (20:52:17 PM):  on the other hand
macy (20:52:22 PM):  "the chance to place words into action"
vicky (20:52:24 PM):  when you're president, words are action
julie (20:52:40 PM):  i agree with macy
macy (20:52:45 PM):  words become action- yes. healthcare hasnt been revamped yet, but it is coming
shania (20:52:52 PM):  hopefully!
macy (20:52:54 PM):  becuase of him
macy (20:52:57 PM):  :)
david (20:53:11 PM):  sure - it could have been calculated - to hold him accountable and pull him into the international spotlight more - but they still bestowed this honor on him, and it would tarnish their reputation if they awarded it exclusively for this reason - with all the pride they have for their country, i don't think they would do this with what is at stake - although it could have been a factor
julie (20:53:21 PM):  what presidents promise and what they do are two different categories
macy (20:53:41 PM):  people wouldbt have a problem with obama being voted prize winner down the road bc they could look back and list the things he put into action (rather than just his precense)
vicky (20:53:58 PM):  I hope so
shania (20:54:13 PM):  Exactly, this is why i'm still not 100% convinced he should have received it
vicky (20:54:31 PM):  right
macy (20:54:34 PM):  the prize winner should not be looked upon with doubt- has this happened in the past i wonder? so much contracversy and disagreement?
vicky (20:54:47 PM):  I'm sure!
vicky (20:54:57 PM):  especially when you're looking at an international award
macy (20:55:02 PM):  i wouldnt marry someone if there was any doubt. lol just a strange analogy.
vicky (20:55:10 PM):  there's always going to be one country that disagrees with an award
julie (20:55:11 PM):  he was a new comer.. it was too early
david (20:55:29 PM):  yeah - proly not - but a lot of times there is disagreement, just maybe not as much - the other issue, is that people usually don't pay attention unless it's someone we all have heard of or can relate to - i mean how many people know who won the nobel prize previously?
macy (20:56:02 PM):  true- maybe the committee wanted people to pay attention to him
macy (20:56:07 PM):  :)
shania (20:56:10 PM):  thats true david. i can;t honestly say i know much about many of the past recipients; i just let it go
david (20:56:31 PM):  yeah, that is possible actually - i def. think - on the other hand, he is the U.S. president and is already noticed and scrutinized a lot
shania (20:57:01 PM):  americans aren't really loved by the world like we'd like to think
david (20:57:03 PM):  maybe for the international community though, they learned about him more and will hold him accountable more
macy (20:57:05 PM):  it was soooo strange of a choice in my mind and i'm sooo out of world news loop hehehe
vicky (20:57:06 PM):  Just looking through some of the previous winners
vicky (20:57:09 PM):  Wangari Maathai won in 2004
vicky (20:57:14 PM):  she has a long list of amazing achievements
vicky (20:57:18 PM):  link
vicky (20:57:24 PM):  I feel like Obama's not there (yet)
vicky (20:57:29 PM):  (hopefully yet)
david (20:57:32 PM):  yeah, americans aren't always loved - so this can fuel disagreement if the arguments are supported
shania (20:57:49 PM):  oh definitely
macy (20:58:37 PM):  yeah- i like to see a list for a winner of a prize
macy (20:58:39 PM):  like htis
julie (20:58:45 PM):  i believe too much emphasis was placed on his race, rather then the efforts he made towards peace
macy (20:58:47 PM):  list of achievements
david (20:59:30 PM):  i dont think so - bc his achievements were listed - and i'd argue that race can't be over emphasized, bc it is so important, it's so determining
macy (20:59:42 PM):  oh i dont look at it that way julie, but rather emphasis on possibilities he may offer the world with not only his race but his background and list of "wants" for the us and world
julie (21:01:45 PM):  i agree, but i feel that may have been one of the reasons he was even in consideration for the award.. especially so early in his presidency
vicky (21:02:15 PM):  I disagree
david (21:02:17 PM):  yeah - of course it was a reason
julie (21:02:17 PM):  he's a symbol
vicky (21:02:30 PM):  I think that was of national importance, it shows how far we've come in some ways
macy (21:02:35 PM):  certainly a symbol
shania (21:02:37 PM):  he has made history in that respect
vicky (21:02:39 PM):  but internationally, not really
shania (21:03:04 PM):  i disagree
shania (21:03:27 PM):  people around the world were touched by his election
vicky (21:03:57 PM):  I think that's more about who he is, than what color his skin happens to be
vicky (21:04:14 PM):  he's an amazing, powerful speaker
vicky (21:04:19 PM):  and a force for change
julie (21:04:20 PM):  it shows how far america has come in history, what does that have to do with world peace
david (21:04:21 PM):  no - it has international consequences - to see someone ascend the social structure from such a poor, victimized segment of the population - all the way to the presidency - and talk about things like cooperation and working together, that sets a precedent for his presidency and gives other nations a reason to hope for the U.S.'s cooperation
macy (21:04:21 PM):  i wonder why they dont release nominees until 50 yrs later
vicky (21:04:40 PM):  Obama was neither poor or victimized though
shania (21:04:41 PM):  exactly, david
david (21:04:49 PM):  actually , he was very poor
vicky (21:04:53 PM):  he's no better a representative of that than I would be a representative of a homeless person
vicky (21:05:08 PM):  he was considered middle class growing up and went to Harvard
david (21:05:18 PM):  and how many black people do you know who are wealthy? not many - i mean the average income for a black individual is a joke compared to what it is for a white, that's just a fact
david (21:05:21 PM):  you can't argue that
vicky (21:05:37 PM):  I'm not arguing racism
vicky (21:05:50 PM):  I'm arguing Obama as an "everyman"
vicky (21:05:59 PM):  no president ever, as far I'm concerned, has been an "everyman"
david (21:06:01 PM):  his family didn't have any money - they basically had nothing, some intellect - but no money
vicky (21:06:08 PM):  if they were, they wouldn't have the money to get elected
vicky (21:06:13 PM):  or the time away from work
julie (21:06:33 PM):  he wasn't poor
julie (21:06:49 PM):  he had money all his life
julie (21:06:56 PM):  hence his presidency
david (21:07:02 PM):  well - why don't you read a paragraph biography on the early life of our president - the guy was lower class, maybe lower middle class - that's a sharp contrast from any
david (21:07:12 PM):  other president i can think of , especially in modern history
macy (21:07:45 PM):  i do see him as differetn from past presidents- hence a feeling of hope for the country
macy (21:07:59 PM):  economically-wise
macy (21:08:11 PM):  anyone can do anything in this country
david (21:08:13 PM):  their family couldn't afford to send him to college - so that's quite a bit different than someone with blue blood who is just born and does nothing
macy (21:08:23 PM):  if circumstance are allowing overall
julie (21:08:32 PM):  can we focus on the peace prize
macy (21:09:08 PM):  so his symbolism got him the prize- are we in agreement on this bit?
david (21:09:10 PM):  "anyone can do anything in this country" - that's the most naive statement i've heard in a long time
david (21:09:26 PM):  right - why don't we just go out and become VPs at bank of america
vicky (21:09:26 PM):  I disagree with that macy
macy (21:09:53 PM):  i wouldnt say that a certain individual is incapable of causing a change for him/herself
shania (21:09:56 PM):  anbody cannot do anything in this country!
julie (21:10:00 PM):  we haven't come to any conclusions yet?
vicky (21:10:12 PM):  according to the committee, Obama won "for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples"
macy (21:10:13 PM):  no conclusion, correct
shania (21:10:20 PM):  no conclusion
vicky (21:10:24 PM):  I think we all still feel exactly as we did coming in
vicky (21:10:26 PM):  haha
vicky (21:10:29 PM):  politics
vicky (21:10:31 PM):  *throws hands in air*
julie (21:10:32 PM):  yep
shania (21:10:36 PM):  haha
julie (21:10:54 PM):  i hate political debates, no one wins
vicky (21:11:34 PM):  well, since we came to a standstill
david (21:11:34 PM):  yeah - this is going to be tough if we have to come to some consensus - i mean, it's a divisive topic, that's the point and why it was selected -
macy (21:11:36 PM):  tough topic
julie (21:11:38 PM):  do we have to come to some conclusion? or can we just agree to disagree?
vicky (21:11:41 PM):  maybe we could talk about some of the other nominees
david (21:11:47 PM):  yeah, we can do that
vicky (21:12:08 PM):  I think we can agree to disagree at this point
shania (21:12:18 PM):  consensus is an illusion most of the time anyway... there are always those in disagreement
julie (21:12:29 PM):  mmhmm
macy (21:13:42 PM):  good talk anyhow i suppose- made me think and rethink
macy (21:13:54 PM):  i'm still thinking lol
julie (21:14:04 PM):  lol
shania (21:14:04 PM):  my opinion hasn't swayed; i still am not convinced, but i do think this is quite the interesting topic
julie (21:14:24 PM):  im opinion is the same as well
macy (21:14:28 PM):  right- i still have my same opinion as when i got here
julie (21:14:46 PM):  i don't think this chat worked out as planned
vicky (21:15:02 PM):  well, I think the idea is more to study the dynamics of the chat
shania (21:15:06 PM):  i truly wish i wasmore knowledgeable and could at least nominate another person!
vicky (21:15:08 PM):  not for us to overthrow the Nobel committee
macy (21:15:10 PM):  no final agreement- as with most political related topic as someone already mentioned
vicky (21:15:29 PM):  One of the links we were emailed listed some of the other nominees, shania
vicky (21:15:30 PM):  link
david (21:15:47 PM):  it proly did i think - bc they want to see how people communicate online, how some people are overbearing and strongly opinionated - or stubborn - or those who yield and are more easily persuaded - i wouldn't assume it's been a failure or a success
david (21:15:57 PM):  we pretty much followed the directions as far as i know
shania (21:16:00 PM):  yes i reviewed that but don't know enough about anyone to back them as a viable candidate
vicky (21:16:29 PM):  agreed, david
shania (21:17:21 PM):  i think we've had a good chat, i'm eager to see just how much obama gets "done" during his presidency and i hope for the best just like evryone else
shania (21:17:46 PM):  i need health insurance! haha!
julie (21:17:48 PM):  same
david (21:17:54 PM):  oh, yeah - inrid bettencourt - a lot of personal and political courage to fight graft - her life was in the balance with drug cartels , yet she advocated for groups that were being exploited - she easily could have
david (21:18:02 PM):  just taken the bribes and kickbacks the cartels offered
macy (21:18:05 PM):  i could just make a comment about how people didnt like my earlier comment- i believe that if people dont think or behave positively, there is no chance for overcoming obstacles or challenges- i just like to believe that things are possible even if not at arms length.
julie (21:18:41 PM):  wish the world was like that
vicky (21:18:49 PM):  what comment was that macy?
macy (21:18:53 PM):  ;) gotta try even if i dont see it happen
macy (21:19:11 PM):  about my view on people can do anything
david (21:19:19 PM):  yes, i agree - we can write our own destiny, be captain of our own fait - we have control, and this is an appealing idea - but with someone like Obama or nearly most people for that matter - you're limited by the place you are in society at the time of your birth, people usually don't climb much higher
macy (21:19:28 PM):  i have personal experience there- or witnessed rather- and it can be remarkable
david (21:19:31 PM):  fate *
macy (21:19:54 PM):  your fate is yours
macy (21:19:55 PM):  lol
david (21:20:20 PM):  i mean you can improve your lot and position , for sure - countless people do - but usually you're not going to go from middle to upper class and be able to touch all these lives
macy (21:20:52 PM):  i dont disagree, life is tough
shania (21:21:13 PM):  i agree david. while we try to think that we live in a classless society, we don't. it's much more difficult to increase your status when u start from the bottom
vicky (21:21:42 PM):  I think our society has a few structures built in to try and level the playing field
julie (21:21:46 PM):  change has occurred though, and its because the people achieved what most people believed to be impossible
vicky (21:21:53 PM):  although it's sort of like putting bandaids on a gushing wound
vicky (21:22:01 PM):  the underlying structure is still pretty hard to overcome
macy (21:22:33 PM):  structure for sure- the foundation is difficult to change even if one or two are able
david (21:22:33 PM):  yeah - there are deep structural factors
shania (21:23:27 PM):  our society doesn't really enable equal opportunity for all, no matter the structures that are present
david (21:23:47 PM):  structural factors like poverty and inequality - but it reflects really well on the U.S. - that someone succeeded like this, and that it gave hope to immigrants and people looking for a more peaceful, prosperous, productive life coming to American soil
julie (21:24:33 PM):  i agree
macy (21:24:40 PM):  yes- public figures make differences
david (21:24:40 PM):  well - i mean this bettencourt lady worked to stop widespread corruption in south america -
david (21:26:12 PM):  so this goes a long way in bringing about peace - whereas most other people succumb to the pressure and the threats on their life in this region of south america where mass killings and kidnappings are supposedly common place for anyone who opposes the cartels, although this could be sensationalized too - i dont really know for sure
vicky (21:27:02 PM):  she said she wants to become the president of Columbia
vicky (21:27:06 PM):  so maybe we'll be seeing more of her
julie (21:27:12 PM):  hope so
shania (21:27:19 PM):  it does show true integrity to oppose such powerful groups that could really murder you and get away with it. i hope we do here more about her
julie (21:27:53 PM):  are we nominating her for the peace prize?
macy (21:27:54 PM):  thanks for bringing up
david (21:27:59 PM):  yeah, hopefuly she stays alive too - i mean it proly sounds ridiculous - but it almost sounds like politicians like her are really targeted by the opposition and sometimes even assassinated bc they want to change things too much and stop the killings
vicky (21:28:21 PM):  makes sense
vicky (21:28:49 PM):  if killing is the tool of choice
shania (21:28:56 PM):  oh yeah david. this isn't ridiculous at all, it happens all over the world and someone that rises up and stands against such power is powerful him/herself
vicky (21:28:57 PM):  when someone stands in your way, or cries out too loud, you kill them
julie (21:29:47 PM):  soo the chats almost coming to a end: so lets sum up
vicky (21:29:56 PM):  Obama:
david (21:29:58 PM):  yeah - but on the other hand - courage isn't the only factor in determining the winner of the peace prize - she did face formidable opposition and threats on her life - but even after all this, she still has to have a measurable impact
vicky (21:30:00 PM):  all against, except 1 for
shania (21:30:11 PM):  agreed david
julie (21:30:28 PM):  ok sounds good
david (21:30:32 PM):  agreed - i say he deserves it
macy (21:30:55 PM):  good chat! thanks all
david (21:31:04 PM):  thank you for your lively conversation - i will think about people like bettencourt and remember her - have a good night
vicky (21:31:08 PM):  went quickly
vicky (21:31:11 PM):  good night all
macy (21:31:15 PM):  g'night
julie (21:31:21 PM):  good night everyone
shania (21:31:21 PM):  yup, it wasa great chat! have a good night!

lynn (18:32:18 PM):  hi
eva (18:32:19 PM):  hello

melany (18:32:32 PM):  helloooo all
meg (18:32:38 PM):  hi
lynn (18:32:49 PM):  i think so
moderator2 (18:32:52 PM):  link
meg (18:32:55 PM):  Sorry, it took me a while to connect
moderator2 (18:33:02 PM):  link
macy (18:33:08 PM):  me too- couldnt find the spark program on my computer - now i know!
irene (18:33:33 PM):  hello
macy (18:33:49 PM):  hi irene
eva (18:34:27 PM):  who starts the conversation?
macy (18:34:44 PM):  well i am the leader for today.... so has everyone checked out the link for the topic?
melany (18:34:57 PM):  yupp
lynn (18:35:12 PM):  yes
eva (18:35:14 PM):  i have it up
macy (18:35:20 PM):  we'll need to figure out which city out of the select would be best in hosting a USA summer olympics
lynn (18:35:45 PM):  right, out of 4 cities
irene (18:35:49 PM):  yeah
melany (18:35:49 PM):  does anyone have any initial feeling towards which city it should be?
irene (18:35:58 PM):  i picked chicago but i'm open to suggestions
irene (18:36:08 PM):  all of them hosted the olympics except chicago
meg (18:36:11 PM):  I really liked st. louis
irene (18:36:12 PM):  and it didn't seem too bad
eva (18:36:20 PM):  *still thinking*
lynn (18:36:26 PM):  wasn't chicago the one where only 70% of peoplke supported having it there
macy (18:36:27 PM):  i didnt have a preference, but reading through looked like some may have traffic issues
lynn (18:36:29 PM):  the locals, i mean
melany (18:36:30 PM):  i picked chicago
macy (18:36:47 PM):  chicago was in the running for what olymics recently?
meg (18:36:59 PM):  winter olympics I think
macy (18:37:09 PM):  oh
irene (18:37:11 PM):  really? i didn't know
melany (18:37:12 PM):  i liked the village they proposed to build for it
meg (18:37:14 PM):  why don't we go through each city and weigh the pros and cons
irene (18:37:18 PM):  well they didn't win so might as well use it now
irene (18:37:25 PM):  good idea meg
melany (18:37:27 PM):  good idea meg
macy (18:37:27 PM):  well we could start by looking at the criteria posted and just eliminate based on that
meg (18:37:40 PM):  Yeah
macy (18:37:46 PM):  ok let's start with climate- an easy one
eva (18:37:55 PM):  well there's one factor not considered
lynn (18:37:55 PM):  they all look about the same in climate
meg (18:37:57 PM):  we could go in order of city? or by what they offer
meg (18:37:59 PM):  yes?
melany (18:38:07 PM):  yes
macy (18:38:09 PM):  climate looks same, yes
melany (18:38:09 PM):  order of city
eva (18:38:16 PM):  it doesn't include how much tourists WANT to go to a particular city
eva (18:38:27 PM):  there's no point in having the money if not a lot of people wnat to go there
irene (18:38:45 PM):  that's true eva
macy (18:38:51 PM):  all the cities are larger ones so all seem mediocre choices
meg (18:39:02 PM):  but there's a lot to be offered by each city though
melany (18:39:06 PM):  i agree
eva (18:39:15 PM):  i guess what i'm wondering is
macy (18:39:15 PM):  ok lets start with the first one st. louis
meg (18:39:39 PM):  It's a nice city
melany (18:39:51 PM):  they hosted the 1994 olympics
melany (18:39:58 PM):  so i guess they know how to handle them?
eva (18:39:59 PM):  i don't know much about st. louis
meg (18:39:59 PM):  honestly, I drove through it a bit this summer, but the only problem was the fact that i64 wasn't done with its construction
lynn (18:40:09 PM):  1904, wasn't it?
lynn (18:40:14 PM):  that was a long time ago
macy (18:40:16 PM):  good point- construction
melany (18:40:20 PM):  oh right!
meg (18:40:23 PM):  it's right next to the mississippi though
macy (18:40:29 PM):  and this is for '11
eva (18:40:32 PM):  will it be done in 2011?
meg (18:40:38 PM):  and it has some good attractions
melany (18:41:06 PM):  and an olympic village
irene (18:41:11 PM):  well are we more concerned with impressing tourists or just the quality of the area itself
meg (18:41:15 PM):  should be completely rebuilt by 2009
melany (18:41:17 PM):  91 percent want them to host it
lynn (18:41:27 PM):  what iwas wondering was that the city had money *pledged* to the event, but if the facilities aren't built yet, that will take time
macy (18:41:34 PM):  keeps it in the running then- but we'll keep in mind construction (but we dont know when its scheduled to end so it could be before '11?)
eva (18:41:35 PM):  well think back to the beijing olympics
eva (18:41:40 PM):  they put a lot of money into it
eva (18:41:45 PM):  but there was still a lot of issues
eva (18:41:47 PM):  for the visitors
lynn (18:41:53 PM):  but they also were very nearly not finished in time
meg (18:41:59 PM):  the construction is scheduled to end by dec 2009
melany (18:42:06 PM):  so they have time
eva (18:42:07 PM):  it's 2010 now
meg (18:42:16 PM):  yeah idk if it finished or not
macy (18:42:17 PM):  so its supposedly done
lynn (18:42:18 PM):  construction on the olympic facilities?
meg (18:42:26 PM):  no on the i64 highway
lynn (18:42:26 PM):  or roads?
macy (18:42:27 PM):  no, the highway 64
meg (18:42:33 PM):  its one of the main roads
eva (18:42:34 PM):  but what about facilities?
meg (18:42:46 PM):  doesn't say
eva (18:42:48 PM):  how long does it take?
irene (18:42:53 PM):  i'd assume we want whichever has the best facilities
lynn (18:42:54 PM):  yes, i was asking about facilities. money is pledged to it, but if they haven't started building facilities, that could be an issue
irene (18:42:56 PM):  rather than the tourist areas
meg (18:42:56 PM):  prob about a year
irene (18:43:01 PM):  although the tourist areas shouldn't be TERRIBLE
eva (18:43:18 PM):  well it's more like
eva (18:43:22 PM):  can it handle the traffic?
macy (18:43:23 PM):  if this is hypothetical as the post states, then none of them will have facilities ready
eva (18:43:24 PM):  enough hotels?
macy (18:43:32 PM):  so we might want to consider other issues?
melany (18:43:39 PM):  i agree mavy
melany (18:43:42 PM):  macy*
lynn (18:43:43 PM):  but la hosted a previous olympics recently, ,so they woudl have facilities ready
melany (18:43:49 PM):  thats true
macy (18:43:53 PM):  good point
irene (18:43:55 PM):  hotels is a good point...
irene (18:43:59 PM):  didn't think of that
eva (18:44:01 PM):  LA can feel unsafe tho
eva (18:44:04 PM):  it's really spread out
lynn (18:44:10 PM):  yes, i thought crime should be a criteria
meg (18:44:12 PM):  I don't think LA should host it again
melany (18:44:13 PM):  i didnt like LA
melany (18:44:15 PM):  when i was there
lynn (18:44:28 PM):  isn't traffic terrible in la? very little public transport, ,from what i heard
meg (18:44:29 PM):  I don't think it has the same tourist attractions as st louis and chicago
meg (18:44:36 PM):  traffic is AWFUL
macy (18:44:43 PM):  i heard negative things about LA also from tourists who were there
melany (18:44:44 PM):  yeah terrible
irene (18:44:47 PM):  you guys have traveled a lot
melany (18:44:48 PM):  i hated it
irene (18:44:54 PM):  i honestly don't know as much about the places other than what i read
eva (18:44:57 PM):  so...strike LA from the list?
melany (18:45:04 PM):  ive only been to LA haha
melany (18:45:07 PM):  i think so
meg (18:45:11 PM):  hahaha I went to CA this summer and drove there and back so I saw a lot of the country
eva (18:45:15 PM):  i used to live there
irene (18:45:19 PM):  In a independent survey, public opinion registered 77% of the Los Angeles residents in favor of hosting the event.
eva (18:45:19 PM):  in south central
irene (18:45:29 PM):  but i guess that's bias because people in los angeles don't represent everyone else
meg (18:45:35 PM):  that's the lowest public opinion
lynn (18:45:40 PM):  yes
lynn (18:45:45 PM):  that's not good
melany (18:45:51 PM):  true
meg (18:45:53 PM):  I'd vote no to LA
melany (18:45:57 PM):  me too
macy (18:46:04 PM):  me too- crowded already
macy (18:46:15 PM):  so they are off the list- ncie!
lynn (18:46:35 PM):  well, i'm inclined to say no to LA, but don't want to count it out yet, it's def down on the bottom of my list, though
meg (18:46:42 PM):  Oh I think St. Loius should stay on the list
macy (18:46:45 PM):  ok- kept in mind as we rank
irene (18:46:46 PM):  i agree with lynn
macy (18:46:55 PM):  what about atlanta- tehy've hosted before
irene (18:46:56 PM):  they've hosted olympics there already so it shoudn't be 100% no
irene (18:47:03 PM):  i odubt they'd bring it up again unless it was at least successful at one point
irene (18:47:08 PM):  most of them hosted before
irene (18:47:13 PM):  but i just don't think california should be a definite no
eva (18:47:18 PM):  hrmmm so chicago is the only one who hasnt
meg (18:47:34 PM):  I think it shouldn't be included because LA is too smoggy!
meg (18:47:40 PM):  bad health for the athletes!
eva (18:47:42 PM):  how do they nrmally pick cities?
lynn (18:47:50 PM):  yes, wasn't smog an issue in the previous olympics there?
macy (18:47:53 PM):  There are specific criteria set out by the selection commission, that factor into this decision, such as Climate; Transportation and ease of travel to and from and within the city, for the athletes and attendees; Accommodation for atheletes and attendees; Government support and public opinion; and Previous experience. You may also consider other factors such as Safety; Tourism potential; and Cultural Diversity.
meg (18:47:54 PM):  people in the olympic community vote for it
irene (18:48:03 PM):  i have no idea how they pick cities, i guess they discuss the pros and cons like we do
lynn (18:48:16 PM):  what about st. louis, i agree with meg
melany (18:48:34 PM):  i think chicago is a better area than st louis from "what ive heard"
macy (18:48:34 PM):  health is a great factor- bejiing had major issues
meg (18:48:39 PM):  Well, if we're talking about crime and traffic, atlanta has really bad crime for pedestrians
lynn (18:48:45 PM):  i like that they have an olympic oaks village already in place to house athletes
lynn (18:48:49 PM):  st. louis, i mean
meg (18:48:54 PM):  and they have one of the world's longest commutes
melany (18:48:57 PM):  i agree lynn
meg (18:49:01 PM):  st louis is nice too
meg (18:49:04 PM):  i agree
lynn (18:49:18 PM):  atlanta has one of the world's longest commutes, meg?
macy (18:49:19 PM):  i'm not liking atlanta for this readon so far: Around 2008 the Atlanta metro area has ranked at or near the top of the longest average commute times in the U.S. Also, the Atlanta metro area has ranked at or near the top for worst traffic in the country.[148]
meg (18:49:20 PM):  I think it'd be easy to cross off la and atlanta based on traffic issues
irene (18:49:31 PM):  well it might be different during hte olympics
melany (18:49:41 PM):  yes definetly
meg (18:49:49 PM):  yeah :-( I think it would be worse during the olympics
macy (18:49:50 PM):  worst traffic in country- is a strong statement
lynn (18:49:56 PM):  yes, it is
macy (18:49:59 PM):  yup
eva (18:50:05 PM):  what about ethnic diversity of residents??
melany (18:50:08 PM):  i read in a magazine LA was number one
melany (18:50:15 PM):  for bad traffic
macy (18:50:16 PM):  for what melany?
eva (18:50:16 PM):  if athletes are from all over the world, discrimination would be bad
macy (18:50:18 PM):  ah
lynn (18:50:28 PM):  but these are the US olympics, not international
eva (18:50:33 PM):  hrmmm
eva (18:50:36 PM):  my bad
macy (18:50:38 PM):  right- thanks for reminding us lynn
melany (18:50:46 PM):  ohhhh i didnt realize that either
eva (18:50:51 PM):  although...not all olympians are the same race right?
lynn (18:50:52 PM):  not that there's not diversity in US athletes...
meg (18:50:53 PM):  I didn't either
lynn (18:50:59 PM):  right, ,eva
irene (18:51:07 PM):  i'm not sure about hte diversity i didn't think of it being an issue
macy (18:51:12 PM):  bringing diverse people into a non-diverse area could be a good thing for that area
lynn (18:51:20 PM):  i have to admit, i didn't really consider that an issue, either
macy (18:51:29 PM):  for something so special like a national event that the whole ocuntry is watching
lynn (18:51:29 PM):  that's true
melany (18:51:38 PM):  yes true
meg (18:51:42 PM):  I think chicago seems nice- they have a transit system that seems really good
macy (18:51:43 PM):  yeah- i didnt see it asw an issue either honetsly
lynn (18:51:48 PM):  but i'm not sure it should be considered more heavily than crime or traffic
macy (18:51:53 PM):  i like chicago also so far
irene (18:52:05 PM):  i agree with lynn
meg (18:52:05 PM):  it's the 2nd largest public transit system in the US
lynn (18:52:11 PM):  i like chicago, too
melany (18:52:11 PM):  me too
lynn (18:52:22 PM):  lots of attractions in the summer
melany (18:52:27 PM):  very clean city
lynn (18:52:28 PM):  easy to get around
melany (18:52:29 PM):  supposbly
meg (18:52:49 PM):  Yeah, its a beautiful city
eva (18:52:52 PM):  just as a note - the reason why I consider diversity is because as a non-white person, I'm personally terrified of visiting a place like st. louis
eva (18:53:19 PM):  so it may be beautiful
meg (18:53:19 PM):  really? I thought st. louis was pretty diverse
eva (18:53:28 PM):  there are interesting myths that float around :-)
meg (18:53:35 PM):  yeah
macy (18:53:42 PM):  i dont know much about st. louis
eva (18:53:46 PM):  certain cultures are raised to believe that the midwest is unsafe for them
irene (18:53:48 PM):  i don't feel any different based on diversity of a town
eva (18:53:50 PM):  i know it's minor
meg (18:53:53 PM):  yeah
macy (18:53:57 PM):  i thought since it was a larger city it might be more open than some other missouri towns
irene (18:53:58 PM):  if it's all people outside of my race, i don't care as long as they don't care
irene (18:54:00 PM):  but that's just me
meg (18:54:03 PM):  no i understand what you mean
melany (18:54:07 PM):  i dont know much about st louis
irene (18:54:28 PM):  but eva i'm sure other people feel the same way
lynn (18:54:32 PM):  my sister lived in st. louis for a few years, and it seemed pretty diverse when i visited her, but of course, we didn't visit everywhere
eva (18:54:47 PM):  well, let's see...we've talked about traffic, construction, diversity
eva (18:54:50 PM):  anything else?
lynn (18:55:02 PM):  crime
macy (18:55:09 PM):  govt support
meg (18:55:11 PM):  money devoted to the olympic buildings
melany (18:55:13 PM):  which has the worst crime?
eva (18:55:19 PM):  that's debatable
eva (18:55:23 PM):  that one
lynn (18:55:23 PM):  probably la, don't you think?
eva (18:55:29 PM):  not necessarily
eva (18:55:34 PM):  maybe Google it?
irene (18:55:43 PM):  i think atlanta has bad crime rates
meg (18:55:45 PM):  chicago has the most set aside- $12 between the housing and building of a place
irene (18:55:46 PM):  but i'm really not sure
macy (18:55:48 PM):  link
meg (18:55:49 PM):  atlanta's really bad
lynn (18:55:54 PM):  i've heard that too about atlanta
melany (18:56:03 PM):  ive heard that as well
irene (18:56:04 PM):  i really think since all of the other places had olympics, chicago should hgave a chance
melany (18:56:09 PM):  me too
melany (18:56:14 PM):  and its suposed to be beautiful
meg (18:56:17 PM):  I agree
lynn (18:56:17 PM):  and they didn't win their *real* bid :)
melany (18:56:17 PM):  and alot of people visit it
lynn (18:56:26 PM):  and it's really easy to get to
melany (18:56:39 PM):  yes it is thats true
macy (18:56:40 PM):  i like the idea of chicago since it has a good transportation system and is used to sporting events
melany (18:56:51 PM):  yes transportation is important
macy (18:56:52 PM):  middle of the country
meg (18:57:02 PM):  it's not really the middle lol
macy (18:57:10 PM):  well ok :)
meg (18:57:13 PM):  :-P
melany (18:57:17 PM):  haha i thought it was the middle too
macy (18:57:18 PM):  moreso than CA
melany (18:57:20 PM):  my bad
macy (18:57:20 PM):  hehe
meg (18:57:25 PM):  it's a 3 day drive from CA
lynn (18:57:27 PM):  i'm leaning towards chicago and st. louis
eva (18:57:28 PM):  i think...I wouldn't vote for LA or Atlanta
meg (18:57:29 PM):  but I agree
meg (18:57:38 PM):  its closer to the middle than CA or GA
macy (18:57:55 PM):  so location could be a factor
melany (18:57:55 PM):  true
melany (18:58:06 PM):  it's kinda significant to be the most centrally located as well
macy (18:58:16 PM):  our current prez is from there- that would be cool
melany (18:58:21 PM):  oh good point
lynn (18:58:23 PM):  what about the time difference thing?
eva (18:58:27 PM):  pretty good
lynn (18:58:28 PM):  yes, true macy
eva (18:58:30 PM):  easy for broadcast
macy (18:58:37 PM):  eh time in regular olpympis is never an issue
lynn (18:58:38 PM):  yes, it's not east coast or west coast
melany (18:58:41 PM):  true
lynn (18:58:46 PM):  well, in this vancouver olympics it is
lynn (18:58:56 PM):  for people on the west coast, ,they are irritated they can't watch in real time
eva (18:59:05 PM):  hrmmm
macy (18:59:05 PM):  but with the internet....we can see everything over and over again
meg (18:59:08 PM):  yeah it kind of sucks
eva (18:59:14 PM):  they do broadcast in real time
lynn (18:59:15 PM):  i think they did that so that worldwide it could be watched at a more normal time elsewhere
eva (18:59:18 PM):  just weird hours
melany (18:59:23 PM):  yes i have a olmpic app on my ipod touch haha
irene (18:59:27 PM):  that's cool
lynn (18:59:27 PM):  not on the west coast it wasn't in real time
macy (18:59:30 PM):  yeah tough to always watch everything you want to watrch
lynn (18:59:43 PM):  at least in calif
macy (18:59:46 PM):  but in us with just 3 hrs- they could better schedule events
melany (18:59:51 PM):  i agree
eva (18:59:53 PM):  strange...east coast gets live broadcast
lynn (18:59:56 PM):  yes, that may not be an issue with jsut 3 hours
macy (18:59:58 PM):  pay closer attention than in international olpympics
eva (18:59:59 PM):  but central time is good
lynn (19:00:13 PM):  yes, i think the fact that it's central time is really good
melany (19:00:41 PM):  me too
eva (19:00:48 PM):  hrmm speaking of the president...maybe he'd attend? :-D
meg (19:00:59 PM):  Probably!
melany (19:01:00 PM):  of course
irene (19:01:01 PM):  he should if there's an olympics being hosted here
eva (19:01:06 PM):  that's a nice element
melany (19:01:16 PM):  it would probably be bizarre if he wasnt there
irene (19:01:17 PM):  although the security needs to be even tighter then
macy (19:01:19 PM):  i like that too- he would def visit
melany (19:01:20 PM):  being that its only US
meg (19:01:25 PM):  I think if we have narrowed it down to st. louis and chicago we should weigh the perks for them
melany (19:01:31 PM):  good idea
irene (19:01:32 PM):  yeah
macy (19:01:36 PM):  sure
lynn (19:01:37 PM):  but he'd probably go anywhere in the US
meg (19:01:43 PM):  I think st louis could use the economic influx
lynn (19:01:44 PM):  sounds good, meg
macy (19:01:44 PM):  true lynn
melany (19:02:03 PM):  The city in 2006 was listed as having the ninth worst traffic commutes in the country
melany (19:02:08 PM):  for ST louis
melany (19:02:12 PM):  that could be a problem
eva (19:02:15 PM):  this is silly of me...but I forgot that St. Louis has good bbq
irene (19:02:19 PM):  hahah
eva (19:02:22 PM):  sort of a cult thing for people :-)
meg (19:02:27 PM):  oh its soooo true!
melany (19:02:29 PM):  haha gotta love it
lynn (19:02:30 PM):  did anybody read that forbes magainze article that said st. louis was one of the most 10 miserable cities right now?
melany (19:02:35 PM):  omg
melany (19:02:37 PM):  thats terrible
melany (19:02:38 PM):  hahha
irene (19:02:38 PM):  oh wow
lynn (19:02:41 PM):  maybe this would help
irene (19:02:43 PM):  yeah
meg (19:02:45 PM):  uhhh boo
macy (19:02:45 PM):  why? unemployment?
irene (19:02:46 PM):  i was just about to say that lynn
meg (19:02:55 PM):  yeah the unemployment rate is really bad
eva (19:03:00 PM):  hrmmm
eva (19:03:01 PM):  Forbes magazine ranked St. Louis No. 4 on its "Most Affordable Places To Live Well" list in November 2007, which rated cities according to housing affordability, cost of living, quality of life, and best arts and leisure offerings.
meg (19:03:04 PM):  my cousin is there doing teach for america
irene (19:03:12 PM):  cool
melany (19:03:13 PM):  oh really? how does she like it?
lynn (19:03:15 PM):  can't quite remember, i think it was unemployment, pollution, and a few other things
macy (19:03:24 PM):  i hadnt read about that
meg (19:03:33 PM):  he loves it, but he says its a little depressing with all the problems of unemployment
eva (19:03:35 PM):  so it changed in just 2-3 years?
eva (19:03:42 PM):  at least according to Forbes?
melany (19:03:45 PM):  oh thats understandable
lynn (19:03:49 PM):  a lot changed in a lot of places the past 2 years
macy (19:03:52 PM):  maybe they need a boost in economny, but could they afford to make changes needed for a big event?
eva (19:04:00 PM):  it would generate jobs
eva (19:04:04 PM):  at least temporarily
lynn (19:04:04 PM):  it would provide work to get ready for it
irene (19:04:05 PM):  what kind of jobs
melany (19:04:07 PM):  perhaps with goverment support
lynn (19:04:09 PM):  right
macy (19:04:10 PM):  good point
macy (19:04:13 PM):  construction
meg (19:04:14 PM):  construction jobs
macy (19:04:20 PM):  vendors
lynn (19:04:24 PM):  and hospitality jobs when people come
eva (19:04:25 PM):  publicity
macy (19:04:30 PM):  hotel staff
melany (19:04:31 PM):  lots of hospitality jobs
meg (19:04:31 PM):  and temp employment in working the olympic village
melany (19:04:37 PM):  hospitality would skyrocket
eva (19:04:39 PM):  security
melany (19:04:42 PM):  and thats easy to train people in
macy (19:05:02 PM):  good point to bring up about st.l
irene (19:05:05 PM):  these are good points
meg (19:05:08 PM):  yeah
lynn (19:05:13 PM):  i agree
melany (19:05:19 PM):  me too
meg (19:05:40 PM):  I think that chicago is a pretty right city, in terms of culture and lack of problems that st louis has but I think st louis could use the economic burst
macy (19:05:48 PM):  and its real close to chicago so still the middle of the country.....
melany (19:05:51 PM):  did we eliminate atlanta?
meg (19:05:54 PM):  *by right i mean rich
meg (19:05:56 PM):  lol
eva (19:05:59 PM):  kinda eliminated atlanta
meg (19:06:05 PM):  yeah
lynn (19:06:07 PM):  yes, i think so
meg (19:06:15 PM):  atlanta- too far and bad crime/traffic
melany (19:06:23 PM):  sounds bad
meg (19:06:26 PM):  as well as pollution
macy (19:06:39 PM):  yeah atlanta out (for '11) : )
melany (19:06:52 PM):  although it seems so up and coming on that show real housewives of atlanta haha
macy (19:06:56 PM):  hahaha
lynn (19:06:56 PM):  hehe
melany (19:06:56 PM):  idk if anyone has seen it
eva (19:06:57 PM):  :-)
macy (19:06:58 PM):  love that show
meg (19:07:01 PM):  hahha
irene (19:07:05 PM):  i've never watched it
melany (19:07:10 PM):  hahha its hilarious
meg (19:07:19 PM):  i've only seen the ones in orange county and nyc
meg (19:07:20 PM):  hahaha
macy (19:07:27 PM):  but they are a certain group of people in that region (meaning well off)
macy (19:07:29 PM):  lol
melany (19:07:50 PM):  yeah and they are the least classy people ive ever seen haha
macy (19:07:56 PM):  true
melany (19:07:59 PM):  not a good sign
macy (19:08:01 PM):  so no to atlanta?
melany (19:08:04 PM):  if thats what the elite are like
melany (19:08:07 PM):  i think so
lynn (19:08:07 PM):  yes, i thik so
lynn (19:08:09 PM):  think
meg (19:08:10 PM):  i concur
eva (19:08:14 PM):  no atlanta for me
meg (19:08:15 PM):  atlanta down
macy (19:08:22 PM):  and LA is also out?
melany (19:08:22 PM):  gooodbyeee atlanta and LA
macy (19:08:26 PM):  ok
lynn (19:08:33 PM):  yes, think LA is def out i think
eva (19:08:39 PM):  i'm starting to lean towards Chicago 
macy (19:08:43 PM):  battle of st. louis and c hicaog
meg (19:08:54 PM):  I vote st. louis
melany (19:08:55 PM):  i think chicago is the best choice
meg (19:08:56 PM):  lol
macy (19:08:57 PM):  that ok eva- why?
lynn (19:08:57 PM):  i like chicago, but i'm kind of thinking st. louis could use the boost
irene (19:09:07 PM):  it already had hte olympics
irene (19:09:14 PM):  i know i keep making htat point
macy (19:09:17 PM):  which one already had?
meg (19:09:19 PM):  yeah but that was a long time ago
irene (19:09:19 PM):  but that's what's most weighing my opinion
irene (19:09:28 PM):  actually
irene (19:09:29 PM):  that was 1904
irene (19:09:33 PM):  so i guess this is more recent
melany (19:09:38 PM):  yeah true
irene (19:09:38 PM):  okay then i'm on the border haha
eva (19:09:42 PM):  Chicago just feels more accessible
eva (19:09:50 PM):  air transport is good
melany (19:09:50 PM):  i agree eva
lynn (19:09:51 PM):  it probably is more accessible
macy (19:10:05 PM):  i like the idea that chicago ahs never hosted, but i also like the idea of the economy reasons for st. louis
macy (19:10:29 PM):  what are other factors- transportation so chicago would rank higher?
lynn (19:10:41 PM):  i think chicago def has better public trasnport
meg (19:10:47 PM):  I think the climate in st louis is better
macy (19:11:02 PM):  safety, accomodation
irene (19:11:03 PM):  isn't it indoors?
eva (19:11:17 PM):  it's similar enough in climate
eva (19:11:21 PM):  according to the info
melany (19:11:24 PM):  its warmer slighlty in st louis
macy (19:11:24 PM):  summer olympics are both out and indoors
irene (19:11:28 PM):  ohh
irene (19:11:30 PM):  hah
irene (19:11:35 PM):  that might've been obvious but i didn't know
macy (19:11:38 PM):  lol
macy (19:11:56 PM):  ok what are some other factors we might consider
melany (19:12:16 PM):  population?
melany (19:12:18 PM):  idk
melany (19:12:18 PM):  haha
macy (19:12:24 PM):  public opinion or govt support an issue at all?
lynn (19:12:32 PM):  public opinion should be
macy (19:12:39 PM):  i cant think of other things not on the posted list.
meg (19:12:40 PM):  publicopinion should definitely be
lynn (19:12:43 PM):  i mean, local
eva (19:12:43 PM):  chicago is at 90 %
meg (19:12:52 PM):  st louis is at 91%
melany (19:12:56 PM):  hmm
melany (19:13:01 PM):  they are so slight in difference
eva (19:13:14 PM):  chicago has a smaller budget not including facilities
lynn (19:13:15 PM):  how about the number of hotel rooms in teh city
macy (19:13:29 PM):  link just food for thought
melany (19:13:30 PM):  i feel like chicago would have more
melany (19:13:38 PM):  but thats just my intuition
lynn (19:13:38 PM):  i do, ,too
irene (19:13:42 PM):  good link
lynn (19:13:48 PM):  but i'm guessing, too
eva (19:13:48 PM):  this is just the website info
eva (19:13:54 PM):  that we were given
meg (19:13:59 PM):  I don't know, I think st louis is really good for sports too
meg (19:14:07 PM):  "best sports city" in 2000
irene (19:14:12 PM):  that's good
melany (19:14:13 PM):  oh wow
melany (19:14:16 PM):  thats interesting
irene (19:14:17 PM):  but who's best sports city in 2010
irene (19:14:18 PM):  or 2009
macy (19:14:20 PM):  Originally awarded to Chicago, but moved to St. Louis to coincide with the World's Fair.[5
meg (19:14:35 PM):  wow that's funny
macy (19:14:36 PM):  so chicago ALMOST had the olympics Interesting!
melany (19:14:55 PM):  i feel bad they ALMOST had it
melany (19:14:56 PM):  that stinks
eva (19:15:19 PM):  heheh
macy (19:15:58 PM):  link/
melany (19:16:00 PM):  where would everyone want to go the most, all information aside?
meg (19:16:04 PM):  so if we voted now, what would you guys choose?
macy (19:16:04 PM):  reasons why Miama will NOT host
irene (19:16:16 PM):  all info aside i'd like to go to la
irene (19:16:23 PM):  because i want to go ot california
eva (19:16:27 PM):  hahahahah
irene (19:16:28 PM):  but that's just my opinion
lynn (19:16:33 PM):  i'm leaning towards st. louis
eva (19:16:33 PM):  the tourist factor wins!
melany (19:16:35 PM):  yeah its a cool place to se
melany (19:16:37 PM):  see*
meg (19:16:39 PM):  I'd choose chicago to visit, but I'd like to have st louis win
macy (19:16:41 PM):  public transportation seems like a big reason
irene (19:16:42 PM):  haha that's a good link
meg (19:16:51 PM):  its only because i've never been to chicago for a long period
meg (19:16:52 PM):  lol
macy (19:16:53 PM):  i'm going with chicago
melany (19:17:00 PM):  i vote chicago
meg (19:17:30 PM):  i vote st louis
lynn (19:17:41 PM):  i vote st. louis too
macy (19:17:46 PM):  link
meg (19:17:50 PM):  we have to come to a consensus
macy (19:18:06 PM):  i'm just trying to find some things online to give us new thoughts- hope you dont mind
meg (19:18:12 PM):  no its ok
melany (19:18:26 PM):  thanks for the help!
eva (19:18:27 PM):  it's helpful
macy (19:18:29 PM):  Commercial development can seemingly substantially from retail consumptions. The Olympic games will bring in extra retail sales to the local. Positive effects of retail sales will be more obvious when it's
macy (19:18:42 PM):  good reason for St. Louis
lynn (19:18:49 PM):  that's why i'm leaning towards it
irene (19:18:54 PM):  these chats make it hard to talk for the whole time
irene (19:19:03 PM):  so i think it's far enough if we slightly go off topic
irene (19:19:12 PM):  it's not like we're talking about tv shows
macy (19:19:16 PM):  that was my reason earlier until i learned chicago lost out- economics is much more important though, especially now and in the next year or two
meg (19:19:17 PM):  yeah
melany (19:19:28 PM):  thats true
melany (19:19:46 PM):  economics are suffering all over
eva (19:19:48 PM):  hrmmm - Chicago just reduced its public transit
macy (19:19:55 PM):  really?
melany (19:19:58 PM):  might as well help out the places that need the most help
eva (19:20:12 PM):  link
lynn (19:20:21 PM):  has anybody here ever been to an olympics,just curious
macy (19:20:30 PM):  no
eva (19:20:36 PM):  just an olympic vilage
lynn (19:20:42 PM):  oh cool
eva (19:20:53 PM):  it wasn't in operation tho
macy (19:20:54 PM):  i'd LOVE to go though
eva (19:20:58 PM):  so it's not the same
irene (19:21:08 PM):  you guys are finding great links
lynn (19:21:23 PM):  i asked just because i wonder if other attractions might be a distraction rather than a good thing
meg (19:21:25 PM):  link
meg (19:21:43 PM):  I haven't beed
meg (19:21:45 PM):  *beed
meg (19:21:47 PM):  *been
melany (19:21:48 PM):  me either
meg (19:21:48 PM):  wow
meg (19:21:53 PM):  I'm good at typing lol
macy (19:22:02 PM):  end of the long week meg- its ok
meg (19:22:19 PM):  thanks
meg (19:22:21 PM):  :)
macy (19:22:24 PM):  long even though i had a day off monday- lol
meg (19:22:40 PM):  yeah, days off for me just mean catch-up work
melany (19:22:40 PM):  hahha today was a short week but felt so long
macy (19:22:47 PM):  So shall we vote again since we are running out of factors to consider?
lynn (19:22:52 PM):  sure
melany (19:22:57 PM):  this week*
irene (19:22:59 PM):  hmm
macy (19:23:00 PM):  state your vote....
irene (19:23:02 PM):  i'm indifferent
irene (19:23:08 PM):  the top two were good to me
lynn (19:23:08 PM):  stst. louis
meg (19:23:08 PM):  I'm for st louis still
macy (19:23:10 PM):  st. louis
melany (19:23:19 PM):  st louis
eva (19:23:30 PM):  chicago
irene (19:23:35 PM):  hahah
macy (19:23:38 PM):  lol
eva (19:23:41 PM):  personal reasons :-)
irene (19:23:41 PM):  good we have a half hour to argue
macy (19:23:54 PM):  what is your top reason for chicago- sorry if you stated already- iget lost amongst the chats
macy (19:24:02 PM):  :)
eva (19:24:27 PM):  i really do feel like they can handle the initial influx of arrivals well - O'Hare is a big airport and major hub of United
eva (19:24:43 PM):  as for the personal reasons - I've been meaning to visit for various reasons
eva (19:24:48 PM):  they have a lot of attractions for me
eva (19:25:03 PM):  which to me equates to lots of attractions period
macy (19:25:10 PM):  but will other people have the same reasons to visit as you?
lynn (19:25:14 PM):  so eva, attractions in the city would be a good thing fro you, ,and not a distraction from the olympics
irene (19:25:18 PM):  is there an airport near st. louis
irene (19:25:21 PM):  i forgot if we mentioned that
melany (19:25:25 PM):  yes O'hare i believe?
eva (19:25:25 PM):  well...it's costly to get tickets to all events
lynn (19:25:28 PM):  yes lambert
meg (19:25:28 PM):  there's 2 airports in st louis i think
eva (19:25:40 PM):  no one can attend all the events - there's not enough tickets
eva (19:25:46 PM):  so...what else will you do while you wait?
melany (19:25:47 PM):  oh i meant chicago my bad
irene (19:26:02 PM):  oh i thought o'hare was chicago
eva (19:26:11 PM):  O'hare is chicago
irene (19:26:11 PM):  i really know nothing about these places haha
macy (19:26:18 PM):  yes- st. louis international airport exists
irene (19:26:22 PM):  okay
lynn (19:26:25 PM):  that's lambert
meg (19:26:41 PM):  oh its only one in st louis
meg (19:26:43 PM):  woops
eva (19:26:46 PM):  man...chicago would generate a ton of business for United
eva (19:26:50 PM):  so if you hate United
melany (19:26:52 PM):  so st louis has one?
eva (19:26:53 PM):  don't vote for Chicago
melany (19:26:56 PM):  how many does chicago have?
meg (19:26:57 PM):  yeah
eva (19:27:04 PM):  link
lynn (19:27:07 PM):  ohare and midway
eva (19:27:08 PM):  3 according to that link
melany (19:27:10 PM):  oh wow
melany (19:27:14 PM):  so thats a plus for chicago
lynn (19:27:14 PM):  wow
melany (19:27:19 PM):  to handle the heavy travel influ
melany (19:27:19 PM):  x
meg (19:27:44 PM):  yeah but lambert is very large i think
macy (19:27:51 PM):  people could fly into o'hare and travel to st. louis to see a part of the us they never saw before
lynn (19:27:51 PM):  but it's just the us, not the international olympics
lynn (19:27:58 PM):  lambert could handle that easy
meg (19:28:06 PM):  and ohare is notable for its long delays
melany (19:28:06 PM):  thats true
macy (19:28:14 PM):  people would also drive into missouri and not all fly
melany (19:28:15 PM):  being that it is only US is a large factor too
lynn (19:28:47 PM):  st. louis also has amtrak, and even the river if people chose to be adventurous and make a vacay out of it
melany (19:28:56 PM):  thats a good point
eva (19:29:00 PM):  well...my apologies, but I'm still not persuaded towards St. Louis ^_^'
irene (19:29:02 PM):  that's coo,
irene (19:29:02 PM):  *cool
meg (19:29:03 PM):  yeah, amtrakl there is a good thing
lynn (19:29:06 PM):  no problem
eva (19:29:07 PM):  of course, it's majority vote
melany (19:29:21 PM):  chicago is a very attractive travel option
melany (19:29:29 PM):  i just voted for st louis due to economic circumstances
lynn (19:29:30 PM):  it is, i love chicago as a city
meg (19:29:45 PM):  i still vote for st louis!
lynn (19:29:48 PM):  i do too
melany (19:29:53 PM):  me as well
macy (19:30:18 PM):  good eceme too
macy (19:30:26 PM):  oopss- me too
irene (19:30:33 PM):  eceme?
macy (19:30:37 PM):  for economic reasons
macy (19:30:38 PM):  lol
meg (19:30:43 PM):  lol
irene (19:30:45 PM):  oo
macy (19:30:49 PM):  end of week....
macy (19:30:52 PM):  lol
melany (19:31:03 PM):  hahaha sighhhh
macy (19:31:28 PM):  i totally keep chicago on the plate though- : )
macy (19:31:39 PM):  and i've been there twice and absoliutely loved it
macy (19:31:46 PM):  you should go eva
lynn (19:31:49 PM):  it's an awesome place to visit
melany (19:31:49 PM):  what a tough decision
eva (19:32:08 PM):  well, I think the decision is made
eva (19:32:11 PM):  there's only 6 of us
macy (19:32:13 PM):  but i've also heard nice things about st. louis
eva (19:32:17 PM):  and at least 4 have voted
eva (19:32:23 PM):  for the same city
meg (19:32:28 PM):  yeah
melany (19:32:31 PM):  yea
macy (19:32:35 PM):  right- we were supposed to pursuade you though i believe
lynn (19:32:45 PM):  is there any reason in particular you *wouldn't* vote for st. louis, eva?
eva (19:32:56 PM):  i just can't think of anything positive
eva (19:33:02 PM):  that outweighs everything else
eva (19:33:07 PM):  for all the positive things you've stated
eva (19:33:12 PM):  there have been negative ones too
eva (19:33:20 PM):  as for economy...everyone is down right now
lynn (19:33:20 PM):  but that's been true bout chicago, too
eva (19:33:34 PM):  right - I'm just saying that there's nothing that outweighs it enough
eva (19:33:38 PM):  you know, that one straw
lynn (19:33:41 PM):  ok, ,fair enough
macy (19:33:44 PM):  fair
meg (19:33:56 PM):  i guess
melany (19:33:57 PM):  i see i see
eva (19:34:03 PM):  nothing to do with anyone :-)
macy (19:34:05 PM):  i think none of us has the proper information like stats to really know the 2 cities well enough
lynn (19:34:10 PM):  right
melany (19:34:13 PM):  i agree macy
meg (19:34:14 PM):  yeah
lynn (19:34:18 PM):  based on the info we have, i still vote for st. louis
macy (19:34:22 PM):  i'm trying to locate some stuff now since we have time
meg (19:34:23 PM):  me too
lynn (19:34:44 PM):  for me the big factor is that it's a US olympics and not international
lynn (19:35:00 PM):  chicago would be better situated and equipped for international
macy (19:35:11 PM):  valid point
meg (19:35:12 PM):  agreed lynn
irene (19:35:12 PM):  good point
eva (19:35:16 PM):  I feel like...they gave us hard choices on purpose ^_^'
lynn (19:35:21 PM):  yea,, probably so
irene (19:35:23 PM):  but is the us olympics ONLY for us residents
irene (19:35:28 PM):  or just the fact it's in the us
lynn (19:35:50 PM):  "open to all athletes from the US"
melany (19:35:53 PM):  yes
lynn (19:35:54 PM):  is what the blurb says
macy (19:35:59 PM):  i would think to enter them you need to be a citizen?
irene (19:36:08 PM):  not sure
meg (19:36:11 PM):  probably
eva (19:36:18 PM):  hrmm...did anyone do a hotel.com check or anything?
eva (19:36:26 PM):  then again...people spend like no tomorrow for these things
melany (19:36:32 PM):  thats a good point
melany (19:36:34 PM):  they do
meg (19:36:37 PM):  its true!
melany (19:36:43 PM):  its crazy
meg (19:36:46 PM):  although st louis is more affordable than chicago
macy (19:36:46 PM):  link
meg (19:37:14 PM):  good link!
melany (19:37:25 PM):  thanks!
meg (19:37:31 PM):  i like the "home of american brewing" link
meg (19:37:40 PM):  on that site
meg (19:37:42 PM):  hahaha
melany (19:37:46 PM):  haha thats funny
meg (19:37:46 PM):  yay beer!
macy (19:37:58 PM):  lol that will be attractive to many
lynn (19:38:03 PM):  definitely
macy (19:38:12 PM):  It almost seems that St. Louis was pre-destined to become a major beer brewing locale. In the 1800s, a lot of things just seemed to fall into place that would help make St. Louis the epicenter of American beers.
macy (19:38:17 PM):  from the website
meg (19:38:19 PM):  yeah
meg (19:38:22 PM):  mmm beer!
meg (19:38:32 PM):  I love beer hahaha I'd definitely enjoy the visit
melany (19:38:35 PM):  hahaha same
melany (19:38:39 PM):  sounds lovely
melany (19:38:47 PM):  that would be a great attraction for tourists
irene (19:38:49 PM):  haha yeah
lynn (19:38:53 PM):  yes
macy (19:38:53 PM):  link
eva (19:39:03 PM):  hrmmm
meg (19:39:11 PM):  brb
macy (19:39:43 PM):  McCormick Place, Chicago’s premier convention center, offers the largest amount of exhibition space in North America (2.2 million square feet).
macy (19:39:49 PM):  Wow!
melany (19:39:50 PM):  wow!
melany (19:39:53 PM):  thats great!
eva (19:39:56 PM):  hrmm...but would a convention center be applicable?
melany (19:40:01 PM):  i think so
macy (19:40:06 PM):  i guess for gymnastics and such
macy (19:40:15 PM):  but it might be overkill? lol
melany (19:40:22 PM):  could be used for many types of tourist booths
lynn (19:40:29 PM):  vendors
melany (19:40:30 PM):  or dinner events for athletes
lynn (19:40:33 PM):  right
macy (19:40:38 PM):  sure like "VIsit St. Louis. You'll love it!!"
irene (19:41:02 PM):  i bet when they had olympics in the past people visited touristy areads
macy (19:41:03 PM):  i was thinking of it like the I love NY ads
irene (19:41:04 PM):  *areas
melany (19:41:36 PM):  yeah
macy (19:42:11 PM):  link
meg (19:42:43 PM):  Sorry, my neighbor asked me if i had dropped my wallet on the stairs hahaha
eva (19:42:45 PM):  seems like there's lots to do in either city
macy (19:43:00 PM):  i think with the limited things to do in St. Louis compared to Chicago, people might be more "into" wathcing and learnign about the summer olympics and what is going on around them like making friends, etc
lynn (19:43:01 PM):  yup
meg (19:43:03 PM):  I was like who's ringing my bell at 7:45??
meg (19:43:03 PM):  lol
meg (19:43:14 PM):  I agree macy
melany (19:43:23 PM):  i agree with macy as well
macy (19:43:42 PM):  chicago really is a great city- and a great place to hold any event probably and actually does hold events daily
melany (19:43:53 PM):  definetly
melany (19:44:04 PM):  this would be something new for st louise
meg (19:44:04 PM):  the coolest thing in st louis is taking the elevator up the arch
melany (19:44:05 PM):  luis
macy (19:44:06 PM):  but st. louis might not get the chance again with its lack of liveliness?
meg (19:44:18 PM):  you can see the whole city!!
macy (19:44:21 PM):  oh the arch- its main feature
melany (19:44:24 PM):  sounds great
meg (19:44:28 PM):  yeah its awesome
irene (19:44:32 PM):  :)
lynn (19:44:43 PM):  so cool not to see anything beneath you
lynn (19:44:46 PM):  from that far up
melany (19:44:54 PM):  id probably be scared haha
macy (19:44:59 PM):  scary ;) but i would def want to see things from there
meg (19:45:04 PM):  it's a little terrifying because the elevator is old
macy (19:45:12 PM):  like creaking???
meg (19:45:13 PM):  but its checked for safety quite often
meg (19:45:14 PM):  yeah
macy (19:45:17 PM):  yikes
meg (19:45:20 PM):  you can tell its old
melany (19:45:25 PM):  scary
eva (19:45:52 PM):  *observing and learning*
macy (19:46:00 PM):  did we find anything else to convicen us to go with chicago??
macy (19:46:08 PM):  major factors?
macy (19:46:22 PM):  for/ against?
meg (19:46:25 PM):  I think chicago is a good tourist city
irene (19:46:29 PM):  i'm indifferent
macy (19:46:35 PM):  i can keep looking for info
lynn (19:46:41 PM):  i'm looking as well
melany (19:46:43 PM):  me too
meg (19:46:44 PM):  the only thing between the two is the economic boost for st louis i think
eva (19:46:46 PM):  i just honestly can't keep track of the factors anymore
macy (19:46:50 PM):  lol
eva (19:46:51 PM):  we've listed so many
melany (19:46:53 PM):  im a chicago bears fan
eva (19:46:54 PM):  pros and cons
melany (19:46:58 PM):  so that would be a big factor
melany (19:47:02 PM):  jk
melany (19:47:06 PM):  :x
meg (19:47:13 PM):  I love baseball and the cardinals are awesome
meg (19:47:18 PM):  in st louis
meg (19:47:25 PM):  chicago doesn't have a team!
lynn (19:47:33 PM):  white sox!
meg (19:47:36 PM):  oh yeah
lynn (19:47:37 PM):  cubbies!!
meg (19:47:37 PM):  lol
eva (19:47:42 PM):  hrmmm...they could always do what they did for a World Cup
eva (19:47:45 PM):  one city hosts half
meg (19:47:47 PM):  i'm a space cadet today
eva (19:47:49 PM):  the other city hosts half
meg (19:47:54 PM):  i LOVE the cubs
lynn (19:47:55 PM):  that would be awesome! a traveling olympics
meg (19:48:04 PM):  because they alwyays lose
lynn (19:48:06 PM):  hey chicago, what'dya say....
eva (19:48:10 PM):  it happened with melbourned and Stockholm
melany (19:48:10 PM):  hahahhaa
eva (19:48:16 PM):  Stockholm got the horse events
irene (19:48:18 PM):  lol
eva (19:48:21 PM):  Melbourne got the rest
lynn (19:48:34 PM):  they are so close to each other, too, ,chicago and st. louis
melany (19:48:55 PM):  yeah i was thinking that
macy (19:49:09 PM):  i like the traveling idea too
macy (19:49:19 PM):  why not do something different?
macy (19:50:04 PM):  so it's a tie?
eva (19:50:29 PM):  i think we're just happy if it's not Atlanta or LA
irene (19:50:30 PM):  10 minutes woo
melany (19:50:33 PM):  hahahah
eva (19:50:35 PM):  if you want to look at it as glass half full
melany (19:50:52 PM):  wellllll
melany (19:50:56 PM):  we need to come to a consensus
lynn (19:51:10 PM):  shall we vote again?
melany (19:51:25 PM):  yes
lynn (19:51:28 PM):  st. louis for me
melany (19:51:29 PM):  st louis
macy (19:51:40 PM):  st. louis (or the tie idea)

lynn (19:51:54 PM):  no prob
melany (19:51:58 PM):  no worries
eva (19:52:04 PM):  i guess...tie if it helps with the consensus
eva (19:52:08 PM):  since it's half st louis
macy (19:52:32 PM):  i think we did a good job though reasoning why the others didnt work out as well
melany (19:52:36 PM):  i agree
meg (19:52:38 PM):  yeah
meg (19:52:42 PM):  sorry i got kicked off
lynn (19:52:49 PM):  at least we have consensus on that

judith (18:30:32 PM):  lol
tia (18:31:19 PM):  rebecca and I were just switched from Group C
moderator2 (18:31:24 PM):  Hey guys, this is .
rick (18:31:25 PM):  cooool
tia (18:31:28 PM):  I do not know what the topic is
rick (18:31:34 PM):  link
moderator2 (18:31:43 PM):  You may begin now.
rick (18:31:44 PM):  US summer Olympics
julie (18:31:50 PM):  funnnn stuff
moderator2 (18:31:52 PM):  The topic is the same for both groups this evening.
rick (18:32:11 PM):  Greetings everyone, I have been asked to mod this group and this is my first time doing so
julie (18:32:23 PM):  exciting lol
tia (18:32:44 PM):  I think whether a city has held as sporting event recently is an indication of whether it is a serious contender.
rick (18:32:47 PM):  :^0
rick (18:33:09 PM):  Like a major team?
julie (18:33:29 PM):  well my choice is chicago
tia (18:33:31 PM):  Okay. I'm not good on football and baseball, so who would that be?
judith (18:33:36 PM):  I agree, I also think that it should be a new city that has not held the event yet
rebecca (18:33:45 PM):  I agree tia... ahd looks like LA is one of only 7 cities whish has hosted more than once..
judith (18:33:46 PM):  I think it should have held sporting events but not the olympics
julie (18:33:52 PM):  i agree
rick (18:34:05 PM):  Yes, the city has experience with crowds from the games
caroline (18:34:06 PM):  but i also think the fact that atlanta held the olympics so recently isn't so good...it's so recent
judith (18:34:16 PM):  yea, it lessens the excitement
tia (18:34:17 PM):  St. Louis looked good at first, but looking harder, there's a reason it hasn't held an olympics since 1904
julie (18:34:17 PM):  all the other cities held the international olympics except chicago
rick (18:34:20 PM):  true
tia (18:34:41 PM):  Spring in St. Louis can be terrible
caroline (18:34:41 PM):  i'm intruiged by chicago
judith (18:34:43 PM):  Chicago I think would be a good choice...it was named the Best Sports City in 2006 which was pretty recent
rick (18:34:52 PM):  Transportation looks a little sketchy in Chicago tho =(
tia (18:34:53 PM):  I agree about Chicagao
rebecca (18:35:01 PM):  yea i wonder what that actually means though.. best sports city
caroline (18:35:12 PM):  yea i don't know
tia (18:35:14 PM):  Transportation in Atlanta looks horrible with the world's busiest airport
julie (18:35:25 PM):  yea
julie (18:35:50 PM):  ive been to chicago... it's pretty
tia (18:35:54 PM):  And is a lack of precipitation a good or bad thing, i.e. Los Angeles?
judith (18:36:00 PM):  I think so
judith (18:36:09 PM):  I would hate to attend the olympics when it is raining
rick (18:36:10 PM):  Probably good, less delays
rick (18:36:14 PM):  lol
rick (18:36:17 PM):  same
rebecca (18:36:25 PM):  what do we think the best temp would be?
tia (18:36:30 PM):  But what if there's no cooling down because of lack of precipitation?
judith (18:36:33 PM):  they all seem pretty similar
tia (18:36:48 PM):  St. Louis is humid according to Wikipedia
julie (18:37:04 PM):  i feel like st. louis is too hot, but the other temps are roughly the same
tia (18:37:11 PM):  Says there is no large body of water or mountains to moderate temperature in St. Louis
rick (18:37:16 PM):  I agreed according to the provided information they seem very similar
tia (18:37:25 PM):  Except it doesn't rain in LA
rick (18:37:43 PM):  What I did was think about my preconceptions of each city
rick (18:37:53 PM):  and put aside all the facts and figures
julie (18:38:00 PM):  the lake off chicago would support a nice breeze in the city
tia (18:38:27 PM):  I thought St. Louis would not be multicultural enough, but then when I googled it, it came up pretty cosmopolitan and multicultural
rick (18:38:32 PM):  "The windy city"
rick (18:38:35 PM):  Chicago
tia (18:38:39 PM):  I think multiculturalism is a given in Chicago, LA, and Atlanta
caroline (18:38:49 PM):  i agree with that
tia (18:38:59 PM):  I think the temp in Chicago is moderated well by great lake
rick (18:39:02 PM):  My thoughts were out of the cities LA seems the most "progressive"
judith (18:39:07 PM):  Yea, and I think the big names would attract more people
rebecca (18:39:18 PM):  only 77% of people living in LA actually want to host it...
caroline (18:39:24 PM):  i don't feel like people would be that excited by "st. louis"
tia (18:39:36 PM):  But apparently St. Louis population is excited to host
judith (18:39:38 PM):  thats why i liked chicago as well...90% wanted to host it
caroline (18:39:40 PM):  i think it would have less of a draw
tia (18:39:51 PM):  What was Chicago a recent contender for?
rebecca (18:40:10 PM):  Chicago was named the Best Sports City in the United States by The Sporting News in 1993 and 2006.
julie (18:40:27 PM):  the only reason i would think atlanta would be to increase their revenue
tia (18:40:33 PM):  President Obama went to Chicago a couple of weeks ago to plug for the city. Was it for a future Olympics?
tia (18:40:57 PM):  I think Atlanta's hosting of the Olympics was going well until the bomb.
caroline (18:41:02 PM):  it lost out though
tia (18:41:18 PM):  Chicago may have lost, but it was second.
caroline (18:41:28 PM):  yes
caroline (18:41:40 PM):  i'm not saying it's bad because it lost out
rick (18:41:54 PM):  What do you guys think would be the top three things to consider for each city from most important to least from the suggested items?
rick (18:42:12 PM):  ie. Transport, Accomodations, Favor
tia (18:42:17 PM):  Good weather. Athletes were not happy about setbacks in Vancouver.
caroline (18:42:21 PM):  experience from past sports events, transportion
caroline (18:42:26 PM):  yea and weather
rebecca (18:42:27 PM):  budget is big too
judith (18:42:28 PM):  definitely transportation
tia (18:42:30 PM):  Transportation and accomodations
judith (18:42:35 PM):  yea i agree with budget
caroline (18:42:57 PM):  transportation is also becoming a disaster in Vancouver
caroline (18:43:09 PM):  recently an athlete was late to his event
caroline (18:43:12 PM):  that's a huge issue
rick (18:43:18 PM):  true
judith (18:43:21 PM):  yikess
rick (18:43:22 PM):  How about safety?
judith (18:43:37 PM):  ummm, i guess if a place is unsafe people may be less likely to want to go there
tia (18:43:48 PM):  I think the top athletes in the world would appreciate easy in and out, not getting stressed by delays in sporting events, and a good place to rest and work out
judith (18:44:01 PM):  i dont know know if safety would be top 3 tho
rick (18:44:08 PM):  kind of goes hand in hand with transportation almost
tia (18:44:09 PM):  I think the spectators want good weather, and a bargain
rick (18:44:28 PM):  Thats a good one, cost of admission maybe
judith (18:44:45 PM):  would a higher budget mean cheaper admission?
tia (18:44:51 PM):  Spectators certainly don't want to spend alot of money on hotel, particularly if not there much, because at sporting events
julie (18:44:55 PM):  well whomever is chosen will have to have enough room to support the amount of athletes traveling to it, like chicago has a 6 million budget for the athletes as well as 6 million for the event itself
caroline (18:45:10 PM):  i don't know if i agree wit the bargain part...i don't think the olympics have ever been something associated with a bargain
rebecca (18:45:26 PM):  I think people going to the olympics would be willing to pay a lot though
caroline (18:45:33 PM):  yes
rick (18:45:36 PM):  Often the olympics have put a tremendous economic burden on cities
tia (18:45:37 PM):  Sorry. I wasn't referring to tickets, I was referring to city for bargain
rick (18:45:48 PM):  Oh my mistake
tia (18:46:02 PM):  People don't like feeling ripped off
rebecca (18:46:12 PM):  Really? i would think they help out the city;s economy
tia (18:46:39 PM):  Many cities, including Athens, hosted games at a loss
judith (18:46:55 PM):  they probably profit in other ways
judith (18:47:02 PM):  gain notoriety, bring tourism
rick (18:47:05 PM):  Should we expect the same level of fit and finish for the American Olympics as the Worldwide Olympics?
tia (18:47:06 PM):  If people come back again
tia (18:47:43 PM):  Yes, this is for the American Olympics, so athletes and spectators are familiar with U.S.
tia (18:48:05 PM):  So, if each one of us could choose to vacation in one of these cities, which one would we choose?
julie (18:48:09 PM):  chicago also has a variety of transportation options, including amtrak, multiple airports, and buses
tia (18:48:25 PM):  Agreed.
tia (18:48:36 PM):  Chicago also has many attractions, but I guess other cities do as well
julie (18:48:58 PM):  and a beautiful lake
tia (18:49:20 PM):  I guess when I think of Atlanta and LA, I think of sweltering sun
julie (18:49:28 PM):  agreed
tia (18:49:34 PM):  I like Chicago
caroline (18:49:37 PM):  i would pick to vacation in chicago
judith (18:49:47 PM):  they also have a big tourism industry
rick (18:49:50 PM):  How much do the great lakes play to cooling Chicago
judith (18:50:00 PM):  which would mean there would be a lot of high quality options for visitors
judith (18:50:04 PM):  in all areas
caroline (18:50:19 PM):  that's a good point
tia (18:50:21 PM):  Beaches on the lake
tia (18:50:36 PM):  Amusement park on the lake with big ferris wheel
judith (18:50:49 PM):  they also have great shopping
tia (18:50:49 PM):  Top notch museums in Chicago
julie (18:50:51 PM):  historical buildings
tia (18:51:10 PM):  Chicago has beautiful gardens in the medians of the roads in the City
rebecca (18:51:37 PM):  I think this is where we would consider the city's safety
julie (18:51:44 PM):  and millenium park is pretty swell
tia (18:51:53 PM):  Has anyone looked up stats on crime in these cities?
rick (18:51:54 PM):  Safety is a top thing in my book
julie (18:52:04 PM):  yes
rick (18:52:33 PM):  Lots of people collected can cause huge problems
rebecca (18:52:48 PM):  Atlanta is supposed to have a pretty high crime rate right?
tia (18:53:04 PM):  Except as we saw in Atlanta, one man can cause enormous harm.
caroline (18:53:06 PM):  i don't know statistic wise but i've been there and i would have to agree with that statement
rick (18:53:09 PM):  I believe Chicago has high crime
caroline (18:53:11 PM):  didn't have the best of experiences
tia (18:53:37 PM):  Is Chicago any more dangerous than other 3?
julie (18:53:52 PM):  comparitively chicago is low
tia (18:54:21 PM):  Then Chicago really has alot going for it
julie (18:54:29 PM):  lol yes
caroline (18:54:31 PM):  yes it does
rick (18:54:42 PM):  Apparently! B-)
tia (18:54:59 PM):  Is there any factor against Chicago?
judith (18:55:07 PM):  i don't see one lol
julie (18:55:12 PM):  not that i see
julie (18:55:24 PM):  at least compared to the others
rick (18:55:26 PM):  Public opinion seems very good, lots of tourism
tia (18:55:31 PM):  Well, how about that it has to build the Olympic Village instead of already having one?
rick (18:55:50 PM):  They would be more modern
judith (18:56:09 PM):  that's true, and i think the fact that it is a new city that has not had the olympics yet is exciting
tia (18:56:09 PM):  What about the possibility of construction delays and cost overruns? Workers going on strike?
julie (18:56:20 PM):  well the other cities have villages because they already had a chance to host the olympics
caroline (18:56:33 PM):  how exactly do olympic villages work?
rick (18:56:33 PM):  What if the athletes found their own housing?
caroline (18:56:36 PM):  what are they like?
tia (18:56:45 PM):  Do we know anything about the history of those cities building their villages?
rick (18:56:46 PM):  Lodging for athletes pretty much
rick (18:57:02 PM):  Often the villages are converted or sold
rick (18:57:21 PM):  added to the cities building infrastructure
caroline (18:57:32 PM):  interesting
rick (18:57:46 PM):  Could be good or bad depending on many factors
tia (18:57:57 PM):  I don't think athletes finding their own housing is an option given the way the games and training work
caroline (18:58:15 PM):  valid point
judith (18:58:19 PM):  this is very true
julie (18:58:20 PM):  well chicago has 6 million set aside to set up these villages and has the room to build themm
rick (18:58:33 PM):  Does 6 million really sound like much?
julie (18:58:38 PM):  yes
caroline (18:58:44 PM):  no
rick (18:58:49 PM):  to me it doesnt but i'm not an architect/ city planner
rebecca (18:58:54 PM):  i think chicago has the most set aside overall right?
rebecca (18:59:05 PM):  12 all together
tia (18:59:07 PM):  Okay. So, are we agreed that not already having a village is not a drawback?
julie (18:59:09 PM):  agreed
judith (18:59:10 PM):  LA has 10 mill
tia (18:59:15 PM):  I think St. Louis pledged the most.
julie (18:59:28 PM):  but there hot and have bad crime s
rebecca (18:59:48 PM):  chicago has 6mil for the village and then 6mil in addition
julie (18:59:57 PM):  exactly
rick (19:00:03 PM):  is 77 degrees hot?
judith (19:00:06 PM):  ooo ok i didnt realize that
judith (19:00:09 PM):  its not that bad
rick (19:00:11 PM):  lol
rick (19:00:15 PM):  77 is perfect
tia (19:00:18 PM):  Why was Chicago named Best Sports City?
julie (19:00:46 PM):  because everyones enthusiastic about sports in chicago
tia (19:00:51 PM):  Wikipedia says St. Louis is very humid, so 77 there is not like a dry 77 in LA
rick (19:01:05 PM):  Yikes
rick (19:01:10 PM):  that...lake
tia (19:01:10 PM):  So, it doesn't have to do with Chicago already having lots of sports sites?
julie (19:01:19 PM):  they have great teams, the bulls, the bears and the cubs
judith (19:01:23 PM):  i think it has to do with their major league teams
tia (19:01:34 PM):  But do they already have all the stadiums necessary for hosting the games?
julie (19:01:53 PM):  yes
rick (19:01:58 PM):  Stadiums good poin
rick (19:02:00 PM):  point
rick (19:02:08 PM):  plus many can be converted for many uses
tia (19:02:24 PM):  So, in Chicago, village might be only thing that needs to be built
julie (19:02:33 PM):  they also have great food
caroline (19:02:44 PM):  i wonder what the other $6 million would be going to then
julie (19:03:04 PM):  probably converting stadiums and equipment
rick (19:03:05 PM):  sporting facilities
rick (19:03:09 PM):  management costs
judith (19:03:12 PM):  "purposes of the event"
judith (19:03:15 PM):  mauybe paying workers
tia (19:03:15 PM):  Promotion
rick (19:03:16 PM):  cleaning
judith (19:03:18 PM):  advertising
rick (19:03:21 PM):  security
caroline (19:04:09 PM):  well it seems to me that they could maybe amplify other areas better than other citys because they can allocate more money to those other things
rebecca (19:04:12 PM):  i found the article about chicago being the best sports city
rebecca (19:04:16 PM):  doesnt tell you why though
rebecca (19:04:17 PM):  link
tia (19:04:27 PM):  Interesting that Atlanta figures only $3 million for building village, while Chicago has $6 million pledged. But Atlanta also has George University residential dorms for housing
rebecca (19:05:04 PM):  even bigger than that is :A
rebecca (19:05:07 PM):  *LA
rebecca (19:05:26 PM):  they have an olympic village already and an additional $10 mil set aside
tia (19:05:30 PM):  LA is not specific to housing
caroline (19:05:33 PM):  it's odd thinking about some famous athletes living in dorms
rick (19:05:58 PM):  Isn't it about the love of the sport/competition
tia (19:06:00 PM):  The Chinese married couple who won the gold in pair skating did not get to sleep together
tia (19:06:05 PM):  That's training for you!
rick (19:06:07 PM):  rather than the amentities
rick (19:06:18 PM):  LOL
julie (19:06:39 PM):  LA is very warm though
julie (19:06:49 PM):  , with not much wind or rain
tia (19:06:53 PM):  LA has a very crazy airport
tia (19:07:05 PM):  Who's been to Chicago's airport?
judith (19:07:06 PM):  LA has horrible traffic
julie (19:07:09 PM):  it already attracts enough tourists
julie (19:07:14 PM):  i have
tia (19:07:24 PM):  What did you think of it julie?
rick (19:08:28 PM):  In my opinion many of the cities mentioned have congestion problems
tia (19:08:35 PM):  LA's weather is probably comfortable in May
julie (19:08:36 PM):  i thought it was ok. Im from new york so im use to busy airports. but i guess it depends what time you go.. i figure either way it will be crowded because of the olympics
caroline (19:08:53 PM):  true
tia (19:09:03 PM):  Well, Atlanta has a big congestion problem because it grew so fast
rick (19:09:05 PM):  Extra crowded even
judith (19:10:01 PM):  i feel like LA is really conjested as well
rebecca (19:10:02 PM):  but being a busy city isnt necessarily a bad thing... they're used to the extra people
julie (19:10:20 PM):  but they don't need anymore
rebecca (19:10:51 PM):  We have to also think that this would'nt be as many people visiting as an international olympics
tia (19:11:14 PM):  Is Chicago pretty central so that no part of country given an extra long trip to get there?
rick (19:11:17 PM):  Right, in terms of different teams/support staff and viewers
julie (19:11:19 PM):  yes, but it would still be alot of people
caroline (19:11:42 PM):  i would say so
rebecca (19:11:43 PM):  yes but a lot of them have hosted olympics in the past, so if they were able to hold all of those people...
judith (19:11:53 PM):  thats true
tia (19:12:15 PM):  The sheet says that this is "open to all athletes from the United States."
rick (19:12:25 PM):  right
tia (19:12:27 PM):  Might create a bigger crowd than international Olympics.
tia (19:12:40 PM):  If everyone thinks they can win.
rick (19:12:49 PM):  Granted there has to be some level of selection
rebecca (19:12:51 PM):  i meant more about people coming to watch
julie (19:13:19 PM):  more people would travel to watch, if close enough
tia (19:13:20 PM):  Well, it could be like American Idol trials.
judith (19:13:23 PM):  so it is only people from the US?
tia (19:13:30 PM):  Only open to US
rebecca (19:13:44 PM):  People might not be coming and staying for a week like if it was a different country
tia (19:14:02 PM):  But if they haven't narrowed it down, like nationals do for Olympics, then there could be all sorts of people there
rick (19:14:19 PM):  How would teams be grouped?
rick (19:14:24 PM):  By State?
julie (19:14:42 PM):  i would think so.. like the best from each state
rick (19:14:44 PM):  if that state puts together a team
rick (19:14:47 PM):  right
tia (19:14:53 PM):  There's nothing that indicates it's by state
judith (19:15:01 PM):  hmmm
rick (19:15:03 PM):  Well i mean for discussion
caroline (19:15:07 PM):  what if it was every man for themselves?
julie (19:15:15 PM):  no, but usually each states hosts it own teams
judith (19:15:19 PM):  how else would they do it tho? if international is by country im assuming national would be by state
rick (19:15:27 PM):  Just an idea
judith (19:15:30 PM):  just like if it were a state olympics it would be by town prolly
rebecca (19:15:32 PM):  what do you mean usually?
rick (19:15:43 PM):  how else could it be done? Independent teams?
tia (19:15:48 PM):  But then how is it "open to all athletes from the US"?
rick (19:16:04 PM):  If you are an American
tia (19:16:05 PM):  Qualifiers as to time for running, scores, etc.
rick (19:16:15 PM):  If you are from anywhere else too bad
julie (19:16:16 PM):  meaning all types of athletes
tia (19:16:42 PM):  Well, if it's by state, then we have 50 states, which might even be more than number of countries participating in winter Olympics
rick (19:17:01 PM):  What do you think about a bracket system?
rick (19:17:14 PM):  Leading up to the Olympics, which could be the final game
tia (19:17:22 PM):  The nationals/Olympics trials are not done by state
rick (19:17:23 PM):  for each sport
julie (19:17:27 PM):  im thinking it would be a lower amount of people then the international olympics but not significantly
rick (19:18:06 PM):  That was my feeling too
tia (19:18:35 PM):  Well, it could be lower, but it could also be the chaos of the American Idol tryouts
tia (19:18:44 PM):  Anyone see American Idol Rewind?
tia (19:18:50 PM):  Nuts, nuts, and nuts.
judith (19:18:57 PM):  hmmm...i dunno. it could be lower because of a small interested population but higher because it is convenient for americans to go to
julie (19:18:59 PM):  no
judith (19:19:04 PM):  and they might be excited for their won olypmics
julie (19:19:23 PM):  agreed
judith (19:19:25 PM):  *own
tia (19:19:54 PM):  I think the Special Olympics gets a big crowd
rick (19:20:12 PM):  Is it televised? I never really hear too much about it
caroline (19:20:20 PM):  me either
rebecca (19:20:50 PM):  But how many people from China alone are in Vancouver right now?
julie (19:20:57 PM):  ?
rick (19:21:02 PM):  Competing?
rebecca (19:21:13 PM):  no i mean how many people come to watch
judith (19:21:32 PM):  hmmmm
rick (19:21:36 PM):  Of, those of which who traveled
julie (19:21:37 PM):  no idea
rick (19:21:56 PM):  me neither, do you think its that many?
rick (19:22:19 PM):  I did see the opening ceremony
rick (19:22:21 PM):  didn't
judith (19:22:24 PM):  neither did i
rebecca (19:22:25 PM):  idk I'm wondering if people from other countries travel
rebecca (19:22:26 PM):  yea
tia (19:22:40 PM):  I would think that there are a large number of people from China and Japan, but not as many as from the US and Canada, given the ease of travel this time for US and Canada
judith (19:22:42 PM):  personally, i dont think i woudl travel unless my own country was participating
caroline (19:22:50 PM):  one athlete is getting married soon after and their mother said they could only attend one
rick (19:22:50 PM):  Im sure there are some... ?:|
caroline (19:22:54 PM):  because it was too much traveling
julie (19:23:01 PM):  look at the beautifulness that chicago beholds: link
caroline (19:23:07 PM):  so if the mother couldn't travel...i'm not sure how many other people can afford that
rebecca (19:23:12 PM):  yea I remember hearing that
rick (19:23:17 PM):  Cool pic
tia (19:23:25 PM):  Some families are being sponsored
tia (19:23:46 PM):  Yes, nice pic
rebecca (19:23:51 PM):  Do you think most of the people watching the games are family or just supporting their country in general
tia (19:24:11 PM):  More for spectators
rick (19:24:21 PM):  Well is more spectators than family
rick (19:24:25 PM):  there*
tia (19:24:25 PM):  But there are alot of family there. NBC focuses on them in the audience.
rebecca (19:24:37 PM):  just found this about the beijing olympics
rebecca (19:24:38 PM):  Beijing expects 550,000 international visitors and 2.4 million domestic spectators
rebecca (19:24:54 PM):  thats a lot of people...
rick (19:25:00 PM):  Beijing was really hyped ip
caroline (19:25:02 PM):  wow
julie (19:25:20 PM):  hmm
rick (19:25:28 PM):  My roommate then was from China and he said that Chinese people were really excited
rick (19:25:34 PM):  it was a thing of national pride
tia (19:25:37 PM):  China put alot of money into the Olympics
rick (19:25:53 PM):  A lot has to do with showing off to the world
tia (19:25:53 PM):  Unfortunately, the buildings have not thereafter been used the way it was anticipated
rebecca (19:26:06 PM):  This is about Vancouver: Maximum estimate of money, in billions, being spent on Olympic security 10.2 Read more: link  The National Post is now on Facebook. Join our fan community today.
rebecca (19:26:19 PM):  10.2 billion!
caroline (19:26:20 PM):  wow
caroline (19:26:23 PM):  that si so much money
rick (19:26:29 PM):  Do you think the National games would have as big of a sentiment to Americans?
rebecca (19:26:38 PM):  yea.... so this is gonna have to be wayyy smaller in scale
julie (19:26:47 PM):  i think it would
judith (19:27:00 PM):  i agree, much smaller
tia (19:27:06 PM):  10.2 billion is less than $40.00 per person in the US
julie (19:27:21 PM):  mmhmm
tia (19:27:26 PM):  We have a population of approximately 300 million
tia (19:27:49 PM):  Of course that includes children and babies
tia (19:28:31 PM):  The nationals, I believe, are held in different places and at different times.
tia (19:28:41 PM):  Done on a sport by sport basis.
rick (19:28:48 PM):  Qualifiers?
tia (19:29:07 PM):  So, this idea of a US Olympics, I believe, would be a new thing for the US, putting all sports together in one period of time.
tia (19:29:30 PM):  Yes, nationals/Olympic trials are qualifiers.
tia (19:29:41 PM):  That's how they select who is going to the International Olympics.
judith (19:30:00 PM):  ooooo
judith (19:30:04 PM):  that makes sense
rick (19:30:05 PM):  In my opinion the final games would be all in the same perhaps week, but the qualifiers between states to narrow the number of athletes would have to be done way in advance
julie (19:30:18 PM):  are we all in agreement that the us olympics should be held in chicago?
tia (19:30:24 PM):  Agreed rick, but don't know about by state
judith (19:30:26 PM):  i agree
rick (19:30:30 PM):  Yeah that was the sentiment
tia (19:30:32 PM):  I'm for Chicago
caroline (19:30:34 PM):  agreed
rebecca (19:30:35 PM):  Yep
tia (19:30:45 PM):  But we still have 1/2 hour to go
julie (19:30:47 PM):  ok just checking
rick (19:31:00 PM):  There would have to be some method to limit the number of people who play
tia (19:31:14 PM):  That's what the International Olympics does
tia (19:31:27 PM):  Number of athletes from each country is limited for each sport
tia (19:31:36 PM):  I think there is a tie in to past performance
rick (19:31:39 PM):  otherwise there will be 50,000 teams for basketball :-p
rebecca (19:31:52 PM):  There would probably be qualifiers I think where it says "open to all athletes from the United States" doesn't mean everyyyyone will be playing that one week
judith (19:32:04 PM):  thatd be impossible lol
rick (19:32:09 PM):  haha yeah
rick (19:32:29 PM):  Right just the top teams would be playing
tia (19:32:38 PM):  But doesn't say how it's narrowed. And I'm not saying this because I'm a fan of American Idol, but because I've seen the Rewind, and you should see the crowds they get and how they narrow down
tia (19:32:53 PM):  The streets are full of people waiting in line to tryout
judith (19:33:15 PM):  are there definitely qualifiers? or maybe its based on past performance?
judith (19:33:26 PM):  actually nevermind, then it prolly wouldnt say open to all US teams
tia (19:33:29 PM):  But if want professional games, have to narrow greatly
rebecca (19:33:32 PM):  in the actual olympics.. or for this?
judith (19:33:41 PM):  i was thinking of for this lol
rick (19:33:54 PM):  I was thinking qualifiers because then there is a level playing field, just skill and points
julie (19:34:00 PM):  agreed
caroline (19:34:07 PM):  agreed
judith (19:34:17 PM):  yea, that makes sense. plus everyone gets a chance to work hard and prove themselves
julie (19:34:28 PM):  sorry i take a long time to read
rick (19:34:35 PM):  The games could go local - state - regional - national
rick (19:34:40 PM):  exactly
rebecca (19:34:40 PM):  yea
caroline (19:34:54 PM):  that sounds perfect
rick (19:35:00 PM):  The qualifiers alone would be a huge TV deal I would think
rick (19:35:06 PM):  just seeing your team rise
judith (19:35:07 PM):  yea, when i played soccer thats how the big competitive games worked
rick (19:35:12 PM):  right
tia (19:35:16 PM):  Well, there's already a setup for some sports in the US that way
rick (19:35:22 PM):  exactly
tia (19:35:34 PM):  I think wrestling and the martial arts
tia (19:35:43 PM):  Soccer, maybe
rick (19:35:58 PM):  How would professional athletes be added to the mix?
tia (19:36:05 PM):  We do have national champions.
rick (19:36:22 PM):  Should their be a professional league and average joe league?
rick (19:36:32 PM):  or everyone is mixed together?
tia (19:36:39 PM):  Olympics is open to all athletes. Years ago, couldn't be professional. Had to be amateur.
julie (19:36:53 PM):  professional
caroline (19:37:11 PM):  i like not having professionals
judith (19:37:14 PM):  i was assuming professional but i honestely dont know a lot about this stuff
tia (19:37:26 PM):  That's when the Soviet Union and other countries supplied a living to all their athletes, and US athletes had to scrape by one way or the other, hoping to get paid for being in commercials.
julie (19:37:49 PM):  we don't want to be the butt of everyones jokes by having just anyone play
rick (19:38:04 PM):  but it does say any american
rick (19:38:28 PM):  so all "professional" athletes?
rick (19:38:33 PM):  but that kinda already happens
tia (19:38:40 PM):  Not limited to professional
julie (19:38:41 PM):  but i don't think they meant it by actually anyone
rick (19:38:46 PM):  hmmm
rick (19:39:06 PM):  I took it as any American can play
rick (19:39:10 PM):  but that was just me
rebecca (19:39:18 PM):  yea I think Its generally open to all Americans, but they have to qualify to move on...
tia (19:39:36 PM):  Agree with rebecca
judith (19:39:44 PM):  agreed
judith (19:39:50 PM):  if u have the talent then u should get a chance to show it
julie (19:40:03 PM):  yes
rick (19:40:14 PM):  anyone make a team and prove themselves to be good
tia (19:40:15 PM):  So, it will be a crowd
caroline (19:40:50 PM):  yes
tia (19:41:08 PM):  And Chicago can absorb them
julie (19:41:16 PM):  agreed
rick (19:41:29 PM):  Chicago would be the final game or final 4 games
rick (19:41:35 PM):  something like that
rick (19:41:43 PM):  of each sport
rebecca (19:41:55 PM):  right
caroline (19:42:22 PM):  i think maybe final 4
rick (19:42:25 PM):  What sports do you think should be played?
julie (19:42:53 PM):  all sports
tia (19:42:55 PM):  I think the US Olympics would mirror the sports in the International Summer Olympics
julie (19:42:56 PM):  lol
judith (19:43:05 PM):  but it would have to be the warmer weather sports, right?
judith (19:43:17 PM):  skiing, ice luging, etc... are out
caroline (19:43:19 PM):  yes absolutely
rebecca (19:43:20 PM):  well only the summer ones yea
julie (19:43:22 PM):  the usually summer olypics stuff\
rick (19:43:34 PM):  link
rick (19:44:28 PM):  What about "American Football"
julie (19:44:42 PM):  prob not
rick (19:44:49 PM):  Really?
tia (19:45:04 PM):  The current football leagues probably wouldn't want that competition for fans
julie (19:45:07 PM):  they already have their own thing going own
julie (19:45:24 PM):  called the superbowl
rebecca (19:45:32 PM):  I don't know if that should have anything to do with it though
caroline (19:45:33 PM):  haha
julie (19:45:44 PM):  ?
rick (19:45:50 PM):  Well any sports could be included
rick (19:45:59 PM):  Or a totally new set of sports
julie (19:46:00 PM):  yes, i guess if they wanted
rebecca (19:46:01 PM):  maybe nfl players wouldnt compete.. but others could
tia (19:46:22 PM):  That's true
rick (19:46:26 PM):  What about the regular person who plays football
rick (19:46:30 PM):  yeah
caroline (19:46:39 PM):  yea
rick (19:46:42 PM):  Baseball is on the list
julie (19:46:42 PM):  anyone can compete, weve established
julie (19:46:44 PM):  this
rebecca (19:47:00 PM):  I just meant I dont think the nfl not wanting attention taken from the superbowl should have any effect on it
julie (19:47:21 PM):  it doesn't
julie (19:47:33 PM):  but they probably want to spend time with their families
rick (19:47:46 PM):  Should more importance be put on the average player?
caroline (19:47:53 PM):  yes
julie (19:47:53 PM):  rather then join another competition
caroline (19:47:58 PM):  i think so
rebecca (19:48:17 PM):  by doing what?
rick (19:48:28 PM):  I mean in the sense "anyone" can play so it wouldn't be all the big name stars
julie (19:48:28 PM):  what does this have to do with choosing where the summer olympics should be held?
rick (19:48:45 PM):  and then the final game would be people from around the country
rick (19:48:58 PM):  Well we finished that part
julie (19:48:58 PM):  are we suppose to be discussing weather, travel and accomodations
julie (19:49:06 PM):  ok
rick (19:49:07 PM):  now we are discussing anything
julie (19:49:13 PM):  lol ok
tia (19:49:15 PM):  I think we decided on Chicago
rick (19:49:18 PM):  filling time i guess you could say
rick (19:49:23 PM):  ;-)
judith (19:49:25 PM):  lol
tia (19:49:47 PM):  I can't think of any other factor that would affect decision of Chicago
julie (19:49:57 PM):  we def didn't need this much time for this particular topic
rick (19:50:02 PM):  Who says we bring back tug-o-war!
caroline (19:50:07 PM):  not at all, this completely strayed
rick (19:50:11 PM):  we're good discusser!

tia (19:52:11 PM):  kickball
julie (19:52:18 PM):  monkey in the middle
rick (19:52:18 PM):  softball
rick (19:52:28 PM):  ultimate frisbee
rick (19:52:33 PM):  frisbee golf
julie (19:52:40 PM):  rugby
rick (19:52:46 PM):  lol
tia (19:52:50 PM):  There is a frisbee game now in the International Summer Olympics, isn't there?
julie (19:52:54 PM):  all these sports should be included
tia (19:52:55 PM):  I know there is beach volleyball
rick (19:53:13 PM):  not seeing it on the wikipedia page
tia (19:53:16 PM):  Another reason for Chicago. The beaches!
julie (19:53:19 PM):  i don't know
rebecca (19:53:27 PM):  do they have beaches?
tia (19:53:32 PM):  Yes, on the lake
rebecca (19:53:36 PM):  ahh
tia (19:54:00 PM):  But I think for the beach volleyball games, they need "clean" sand. That is, no broken shells to possibly cut athlete's feet
rick (19:54:14 PM):  truck in sand
rick (19:54:21 PM):  or play on a closed court
julie (19:54:26 PM):  yea
rebecca (19:54:27 PM):  Yea idk if they necessarily need to be on the beach anyway..
caroline (19:54:27 PM):  they mightu se their own sand
rick (19:54:36 PM):  filter sand
julie (19:54:59 PM):  box ball
tia (19:55:11 PM):  Okay five minutes to go.

rebecca (18:35:10 PM):  where is the topic info?
vicky (18:35:13 PM):  we've come to do a take-over
vicky (18:35:15 PM):  (kidding)
moderator (18:35:17 PM):  Ok, you may begin now.
julie (18:35:25 PM):  yay
moderator (18:35:27 PM):  link
rebecca (18:35:35 PM):  thanks
julie (18:35:51 PM):  howdy all
tia (18:35:55 PM):  hi
tia (18:36:15 PM):  is everyone ready?
vicky (18:36:15 PM):  maybe we could take an initial vote if people are leaning toward a, b, or c?
tia (18:36:27 PM):  a
irene (18:36:34 PM):  hi
vicky (18:36:41 PM):  I'd be b
cinthia (18:36:49 PM):  i honestly am not sure
julie (18:37:01 PM):  im going with a
luke (18:37:12 PM):  im a little unsure as well
rebecca (18:37:12 PM):  hmm im leaning towards b...
tia (18:37:15 PM):  I say a because I think we need to protect water more than anything
irene (18:37:36 PM):  this is difficult
vicky (18:37:42 PM):  I think that b would meet the goals of a
cinthia (18:37:56 PM):  air as well
cinthia (18:38:00 PM):  considering the atmosphere
vicky (18:38:01 PM):  if we use a cleaner energy source, we are protecting all resources from pollution
vicky (18:38:02 PM):  hopefully
irene (18:38:04 PM):  they are all very important
irene (18:38:16 PM):  different, but important
rebecca (18:38:27 PM):  yea this is a hard one
julie (18:38:28 PM):  a includes most of the topics
cinthia (18:38:50 PM):  except for animals
cinthia (18:39:01 PM):  oh woops
cinthia (18:39:04 PM):  no it does
rebecca (18:39:07 PM):  oh I didnt realize each one only applies to some
tia (18:39:21 PM):  It's my belief that if one keeps companies from polluting, they will develop clean energy
vicky (18:39:37 PM):  so you believe a --> b, and I believe b---> a :)
vicky (18:39:51 PM):  what about everybody else?
julie (18:40:06 PM):  im still on a
julie (18:40:19 PM):  i feel as if pollution effects all those aspects
irene (18:40:29 PM):  i'm still undecided
josh (18:40:30 PM):  the most important things on this list is 1 and 5
irene (18:40:31 PM):  i agree with julie
julie (18:40:33 PM):  if fixed it can lead to a better healthier planet
irene (18:40:43 PM):  definitely
irene (18:41:03 PM):  ok let's think about how each one affects all of the others
julie (18:41:16 PM):  good point irene@
julie (18:41:19 PM):  !
josh (18:41:26 PM):  they basically all affect each other
cinthia (18:41:40 PM):  of course josh
cinthia (18:41:43 PM):  duh
tia (18:41:49 PM):  Water could be used more efficiently in New York; but most of all, it is under threat from pollution, like acid rain.
irene (18:41:57 PM):  air: without air, we can't breathe. without plants, we will miss certain nutrients. plus herbivores need them, and we eat animals. minerals provide nutrients for plants who feed humans and animals. water provides something to drink
luke (18:42:04 PM):  that is true
tia (18:42:15 PM):  Also, the new threat is natural gas fracking which may pollute our ground water
irene (18:42:22 PM):  fracking?
vicky (18:42:30 PM):  that's a big issue in the fingerlakes
julie (18:42:34 PM):  we shouldnt rely on fossil fuels
tia (18:42:36 PM):  That's the new way of getting natural gas out of the land
julie (18:42:37 PM):  or focus on them
vicky (18:42:42 PM):  there was a fight to prevent natural gas drilling there, but the people lost
julie (18:42:50 PM):  we need to support widelife and diversity
tia (18:42:50 PM):  Right now, fracking is before the DEC and the Governor
irene (18:42:53 PM):  global warming is ruining all of these!
cinthia (18:43:02 PM):  true irene
tia (18:43:06 PM):  If allowed, it has the possibility of contaminating the water supplies
luke (18:43:08 PM):  what exactly is fracking?
julie (18:43:23 PM):  i hate global warming
vicky (18:43:31 PM):  luke: link
julie (18:43:37 PM):  always ruining my fun
luke (18:43:44 PM):  thanks vicky
tia (18:43:44 PM):  Drilling used to be only done by going vertically, that is, drilling straight down into the ground
irene (18:44:06 PM):  you know what's the least fun? being DEAD
vicky (18:44:10 PM):  no problem
julie (18:44:11 PM):  water i believe is the most important on this list
irene (18:44:11 PM):  if we lack any of these
vicky (18:44:15 PM):  lol @ irene
irene (18:44:18 PM):  :)
julie (18:44:18 PM):  it separates this planet from the rest
vicky (18:44:19 PM):  I agree, being dead is least fun
tia (18:44:20 PM):  Fracking is the use of extreme amounts of water pressure to break shale in the ground, allowing extraction devices to go horizontally into the ground
irene (18:44:27 PM):  that's a good point julie. very good point.
tia (18:44:27 PM):  and extract the natural gas
julie (18:44:33 PM):  protect the water!
tia (18:44:49 PM):  So I think they chose this topic because it is a hot debate right now
irene (18:44:53 PM):  yeah
julie (18:44:58 PM):  yes
julie (18:45:01 PM):  HOT
cinthia (18:45:01 PM):  and its gonna be a tough one
irene (18:45:07 PM):  they definitely have reasoning for the topics they pick
tia (18:45:24 PM):  It is pitting those who want to profit from the extraction of natural gas in NY
julie (18:45:33 PM):  they are all good topics, but i feel one affects them all
tia (18:45:35 PM):  and we have a huge source
julie (18:45:38 PM):  we just need to think
tia (18:45:46 PM):  against those who feel the most important thing is to protect our water
cinthia (18:45:50 PM):  lets attack them one by one
vicky (18:45:57 PM):  good idea, cinthia
julie (18:46:01 PM):  agreed
irene (18:46:02 PM):  let's say why they WOULDNT be important
luke (18:46:09 PM):  yeaa
julie (18:46:11 PM):  whoooa
julie (18:46:20 PM):  ok
rebecca (18:46:27 PM):  resources?
tia (18:46:33 PM):  I don't think we can say any are not important
irene (18:46:38 PM):  well true
julie (18:46:41 PM):  id say they are all important though
vicky (18:46:41 PM):  well I think we agree they are all important
irene (18:46:43 PM):  but maybe they have aspects we can live without
vicky (18:46:52 PM):  maybe just look at why each issue may be less important, or more problematic
julie (18:46:58 PM):  air?
luke (18:46:59 PM):  well atleast this topic will take a little longer than the last one....
irene (18:47:00 PM):  i think we could live without animals and eat plants forever
cinthia (18:47:01 PM):  need it
irene (18:47:02 PM):  we'd just be unhealthy
vicky (18:47:02 PM):  how can the $100,000 best be spent to have the most effect
irene (18:47:09 PM):  but maybe we'd evolve into herbivores
irene (18:47:26 PM):  which one is at most risk
julie (18:47:27 PM):  but humans cant fully digest plants
irene (18:47:38 PM):  what do you mean
tia (18:47:51 PM):  Currently water in NY is most at risk, I believe
julie (18:47:55 PM):  are body cant break down their minerals
julie (18:47:56 PM):  like cows can
josh (18:47:57 PM):  well if we pick A then it is helping almost all of the resources. if one of those resources gets polluted then everything else gets ruined as well
tia (18:48:00 PM):  Air is a world problem
julie (18:48:00 PM):  they have 2 stomachs
tia (18:48:06 PM):  Because air does not stay still
rebecca (18:48:08 PM):  when they say develop efficient means to utilize 1 and 5... do you think they mean cheap.. or environmentally?
vicky (18:48:19 PM):  not sure
luke (18:48:30 PM):  Well i guess it would have to be whatever is enough
tia (18:48:40 PM):  They say efficient so I think that means both
irene (18:48:44 PM):  i agree with tia
julie (18:48:52 PM):  im not sure
josh (18:49:03 PM):  they say...if Air, wind and atmosphere were utilized efficiently , the reliance on Coal, fossil fuels, rock and minerals would be lessened, resulting in less pollution and other advantageous benefits.
julie (18:49:14 PM):  the most important things are air, and water
tia (18:49:14 PM):  Wind has been controversial because there are only certain spots where windmills would be efficient
julie (18:49:19 PM):  supported by plants
vicky (18:49:20 PM):  I agree josh
julie (18:49:25 PM):  which support animals
tia (18:49:28 PM):  But those spots tend to be scenic
vicky (18:49:35 PM):  that was my thinking of focusing on b, because it would lead to a as a positive side effect
tia (18:49:47 PM):  And many localities do not want windmills ruining their views
julie (18:50:00 PM):  this is true vicky
vicky (18:50:28 PM):  I love the idea of windmills, it's a very clean source of energy
cinthia (18:50:29 PM):  josh r u a bio major
irene (18:50:39 PM):  is anyone here a bio major?
julie (18:50:44 PM):  nope
tia (18:50:47 PM):  Except when you see the technologies that are coming out, which appear to be able to outdo solar and wind once they become mass produced
luke (18:50:48 PM):  noooo
vicky (18:50:50 PM):  the issue with them right now is that the grid is not currently equipped to deal with fluctuating levels of power
tia (18:50:54 PM):  Just the other day on the news
tia (18:51:00 PM):  They were showing a fuel cell
tia (18:51:04 PM):  made of sand and natural gas
tia (18:51:07 PM):  that is self-contained
vicky (18:51:11 PM):  really?
tia (18:51:13 PM):  and continually produces energy
tia (18:51:21 PM):  It is anticipated that once mass produced
vicky (18:51:23 PM):  that's awesome, do you know what it was called?
tia (18:51:29 PM):  there will be $3,000.00 units
tia (18:51:33 PM):  that each home can have
julie (18:51:36 PM):  interesting
tia (18:51:38 PM):  and produce energy for its own use
vicky (18:51:50 PM):  you know a problem with that though, tia?
tia (18:51:50 PM):  Hope it wasn't something I said!
tia (18:51:57 PM):  What?
irene (18:52:05 PM):  sorry i lost connection
vicky (18:52:06 PM):  businesses don't want people to buy a thing from them that makes them independent for an indetermidavid length of time
vicky (18:52:13 PM):  they would want to tack on a usage fee
tia (18:52:19 PM):  That is a problem
luke (18:52:23 PM):  yeaaaa
vicky (18:52:23 PM):  or change the technology so a new unit has to be purchased every x number of years
tia (18:52:26 PM):  Except that things are changing
irene (18:52:35 PM):  everything chnages
tia (18:52:38 PM):  Currently, many businesses, including ebay
tia (18:52:46 PM):  are using these new fuel cells
julie (18:52:47 PM):  so im aware what are everyones choices so far?
cinthia (18:52:56 PM):  a
julie (18:52:58 PM):  mines b
vicky (18:52:59 PM):  b
irene (18:53:05 PM):  b
tia (18:53:07 PM):  Unfortudavidly, they are massive and in the $800,000-$900,000.00 range
irene (18:53:08 PM):  or wait
rebecca (18:53:08 PM):  ahh not sure...
tia (18:53:14 PM):  I'm still a
josh (18:53:18 PM):  a
vicky (18:53:19 PM):  is anyone c?
luke (18:53:20 PM):  i think i would have to go with b as well at this point
irene (18:53:24 PM):  a or b i'm stuck
julie (18:53:34 PM):  i guess it's bet a and b
julie (18:53:40 PM):  c sucks
rebecca (18:53:44 PM):  i want to say b... but a could include b already..
vicky (18:53:44 PM):  if we can elimidavid c we can just debate pros and cons of a vs. b
tia (18:53:49 PM):  They say in ten years the new fuel cells should be available for homes
tia (18:54:02 PM):  okay with me for a vs. b
vicky (18:54:37 PM):  I found a link about that fuel cell tia
vicky (18:54:42 PM):  if anyone's interested, it's here: link
tia (18:54:42 PM):  Great
vicky (18:54:46 PM):  the cells are called bloom boxes
cinthia (18:54:48 PM):  did anyone read the bottom
vicky (18:54:51 PM):  very interesting!
cinthia (18:55:02 PM):  like about how...if Plants, Forests and Pastures were not managed and used limitedly or protected from pollution they would eventually be depleted and this would impact the presence of Water, lakes, groundwater and rivers , which would in turn affect Animals and Wildlife and so on.
tia (18:55:30 PM):  But it all starts with water doesn't it?
tia (18:55:52 PM):  If I recall the creation of earth
tia (18:55:59 PM):  we had living cells in the water
tia (18:56:06 PM):  before we had enough oxygen in the air
vicky (18:56:06 PM):  well pollution generally effects all of it tia
tia (18:56:08 PM):  to support life
julie (18:56:13 PM):  yes
tia (18:56:13 PM):  of course it does
tia (18:56:31 PM):  But what's the worst thing?
josh (18:56:49 PM):  this question is like a lose lose situation if we exclude one than everything is going to be eventually affected and ruined anyway
irene (18:56:59 PM):  i agree with josh
luke (18:57:02 PM):  yeaa me too
cinthia (18:57:05 PM):  well we gotta think tho
cinthia (18:57:10 PM):  like were not gonna lose everything
tia (18:57:11 PM):  We're being asked to spend $100,000 the best way possible
julie (18:57:13 PM):  well we need to go with what's most important
cinthia (18:57:20 PM):  were just using the $$ to help the environment
tia (18:57:26 PM):  The world is not going to fall apart in that time, I hope not
julie (18:57:33 PM):  me too
cinthia (18:57:34 PM):  maybe in the next ten years we can switch to the things we left out
luke (18:57:36 PM):  yeaaa really it comes down to whatvever is going to last the longest
rebecca (18:57:51 PM):  or what will lead to the most positive results
julie (18:57:57 PM):  yes
tia (18:58:02 PM):  What happens if they allow the fracking and our water is contamidavidd for centuries
tia (18:58:11 PM):  We can't get our ground water back
tia (18:58:19 PM):  There is no possibility of that right now
tia (18:58:29 PM):  We can grow trees
tia (18:58:45 PM):  We have centers that are saving seeds
cinthia (18:58:50 PM):  so number 5 has to be involved
tia (18:58:59 PM):  So that extinct species may once again come back
cinthia (18:59:17 PM):  what do u mean come back?
julie (18:59:23 PM):  im siding with b because it affects all the things on the life and includes 5
tia (18:59:27 PM):  We can desalidavid water from the ocean (very expensive)
irene (18:59:40 PM):  if we do #1 we have 20,000 for each thing
irene (18:59:43 PM):  that's a lot of money
julie (18:59:58 PM):  irene you make excellent points
cinthia (19:00:06 PM):  u mean 25,000?
josh (19:00:08 PM):  its $25,000 each
irene (19:00:14 PM):  no it's for 5 things
irene (19:00:19 PM):  so 20,000
josh (19:00:20 PM):  its for 4
tia (19:00:23 PM):  I'm not following
vicky (19:00:26 PM):  well those are just examples of natural resources
irene (19:00:26 PM):  ohhh
irene (19:00:28 PM):  right
josh (19:00:30 PM):  they leave out number 4
vicky (19:00:32 PM):  we need to pick a, b, or c
irene (19:00:35 PM):  i thought it said 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
vicky (19:00:38 PM):  but the funds could be used for whatever
julie (19:00:43 PM):  yes
vicky (19:01:02 PM):  oh wait oops
vicky (19:01:06 PM):  reading directions is good :)
vicky (19:01:11 PM):  we do have to eventually pick one natural resource
luke (19:01:15 PM):  yeaa its worded a little weird haha
vicky (19:01:16 PM):  after we decide on a or b
julie (19:01:24 PM):  b
irene (19:01:36 PM):  sorry about that
tia (19:01:55 PM):  nothing to be sorry about
julie (19:02:23 PM):  i believe we can resolve this
vicky (19:02:27 PM):  I'm not sure anybody else noticed it either
julie (19:02:28 PM):  peacefully
vicky (19:02:30 PM):  I know I didn't
rebecca (19:02:31 PM):  nope i didnt
rebecca (19:02:41 PM):  making it even harder...
julie (19:02:42 PM):  nope
cinthia (19:02:48 PM):  so what do we have to do... choose just one
julie (19:02:54 PM):  yes
cinthia (19:02:54 PM):  like only air...
cinthia (19:03:00 PM):  or air, wind, atmosphere
irene (19:03:15 PM):  i like b
luke (19:03:15 PM):  I would have to say b because those two numbers include the resources that #2 and #5 would not survive without
irene (19:03:24 PM):  if we utilize water and air well, everything else should be fine
irene (19:03:34 PM):  none of htem are perfect because we can't fix everything
rebecca (19:03:39 PM):  but you have to pick one resource and then decide a,b, or c
luke (19:03:43 PM):  coal and fossil fules are important but like people said, there are other ways to create energy
tia (19:03:52 PM):  You can utilize something well (that is, conserve use), but it's meaningless if the resource gets polluted
josh (19:04:00 PM):  true
julie (19:04:10 PM):  yes
tia (19:04:18 PM):  Overall, I think we do well on not overusing our water supply
tia (19:04:24 PM):  And of course, air is air
julie (19:04:27 PM):  i choose air
cinthia (19:04:53 PM):  air
tia (19:04:57 PM):  Atmosphere is weird because that's a world thing
julie (19:05:01 PM):  actually water, because water affects trees and plants which supplies water
tia (19:05:07 PM):  NY can't do much to control the atmosphere
vicky (19:05:19 PM):  I'm not sure what we could do about a clean air initiative with only $100k
julie (19:05:25 PM):  air*
rebecca (19:05:31 PM):  yea we have to think that this is more on a local level.. this is just albany
vicky (19:05:41 PM):  I know that we could do some things to clean up a local water supply... clean up a polluted lake with it
vicky (19:05:46 PM):  or invest in clean technology
julie (19:05:56 PM):  we must protect the atmosphere
julie (19:06:09 PM):  or we will lose the air
irene (19:06:17 PM):  hmm
luke (19:06:32 PM):  true true
tia (19:06:42 PM):  The solution to the hole is the ozone came from a worldwide ban on the main cause
tia (19:06:51 PM):  That's "in" the ozone
rebecca (19:07:02 PM):  but which needs the most immediate help air or water... or something else
tia (19:07:13 PM):  Currently, in NY, I would say it's water
josh (19:07:13 PM):  we are going to be dead by the time the air is completely polluted so i think we should go for water
julie (19:07:14 PM):  water, which affects air
tia (19:07:44 PM):  Well, water does get polluted from the particles in the air, which is how acid in the air in other states turns into acid rain in NY
cinthia (19:07:56 PM):  what about our children josh
tia (19:07:57 PM):  That said, though, I'm still for water
cinthia (19:08:07 PM):  were gonna be dead by the time any of this really takes a turn for the WORST
irene (19:08:17 PM):  haha that might be true
tia (19:08:26 PM):  If you travel to other parts of the world, you'd see that it's already here
irene (19:08:27 PM):  silly cinthia
luke (19:08:35 PM):  tricks are for kids
irene (19:08:35 PM):  well not realy
irene (19:08:37 PM):  kinda sad
irene (19:08:39 PM):  silly luke!
julie (19:08:40 PM):  we have to think about the children!
vicky (19:08:45 PM):  meh
vicky (19:08:53 PM):  children, pshaw
irene (19:08:53 PM):  more htan meh
irene (19:08:56 PM):  it's the end of hte owlrd
vicky (19:08:56 PM):  let's burn it down...
cinthia (19:08:56 PM):  CHILDREN
vicky (19:08:58 PM):  no wait, oops
irene (19:08:58 PM):  *the end of hte world
vicky (19:09:02 PM):  :)
luke (19:09:11 PM):  haha
julie (19:09:24 PM):  the world is a valuable resourse
cinthia (19:09:26 PM):  silly luke
julie (19:09:38 PM):  we must do everything in our power to save it
julie (19:09:44 PM):  like the power rangers
rebecca (19:09:49 PM):  but we don't have too much power...
luke (19:09:50 PM):  yea or atleast slow things down
julie (19:09:51 PM):  water is gold
rebecca (19:09:54 PM):  only $100,000
irene (19:09:57 PM):  water is more important than gold
irene (19:09:59 PM):  we can live without gold
irene (19:10:01 PM):  at least i htink so
irene (19:10:03 PM):  that would be a mineral right
tia (19:10:05 PM):  water is the new oil in terms of being a commodity
vicky (19:10:10 PM):  we could spend the $100k on power rangers uniforms for the population of Albany...
vicky (19:10:15 PM):  let's call it advertising
julie (19:10:17 PM):  yes
rebecca (19:10:19 PM):  oooh i vote for that!
julie (19:10:20 PM):  agreed
julie (19:10:30 PM):  count me in vicky
luke (19:10:30 PM):  shotty white ranger
julie (19:10:37 PM):  pink!
rebecca (19:10:38 PM):  pink!
rebecca (19:10:40 PM):  damn
julie (19:10:43 PM):  fight to the death
josh (19:10:44 PM):  what about captain america
irene (19:10:44 PM):  great idea vicky
vicky (19:10:49 PM):  :-D
vicky (19:10:58 PM):  captain planet, josh?
josh (19:10:58 PM):  i mean captain planet
rebecca (19:11:07 PM):  lol
irene (19:11:07 PM):  captain planet to save the planet!
julie (19:11:08 PM):  he's our hero
cinthia (19:11:12 PM):  ok well im wonderwoman
irene (19:11:17 PM):  hahahha
tia (19:11:17 PM):  Wasn't Captain Planet a Ted Turner cartoon?
irene (19:11:20 PM):  not sure
julie (19:11:21 PM):  ?
irene (19:11:34 PM):  if we actually advertise about the EARTH while using things people care about
tia (19:11:34 PM):  Ted Turner, founder of CNN
irene (19:11:39 PM):  it can get people to listen
tia (19:11:42 PM):  He's a big environmentalist
julie (19:11:44 PM):  well if i was to choose to be an element i would choose water
irene (19:11:45 PM):  if the pink ranger tells me to conserve water
irene (19:11:48 PM):  i have no choice but to listen
rebecca (19:11:57 PM):  this is true..
irene (19:12:14 PM):  definitely
julie (19:12:21 PM):  and pink ranger is awesome
tia (19:12:22 PM):  julie, that's very taoist
luke (19:12:22 PM):  mighty morphin'
cinthia (19:12:34 PM):  i wanna be the yellow ranger
cinthia (19:12:38 PM):  cuz her name was cinthia once
irene (19:12:43 PM):  there's too many people and not enough rangers
irene (19:12:48 PM):  i'm going to be that whiny thing that talks ot the head
julie (19:12:57 PM):  you would
irene (19:13:08 PM):  cinthia has a good point
luke (19:13:08 PM):  lol
tia (19:13:11 PM):  Well, if you had a choice of drinking polluted water or breathing polluted air, which would you take?
irene (19:13:15 PM):  hm
vicky (19:13:22 PM):  there's always vodka, tia
luke (19:13:23 PM):  breathing polluted airr
irene (19:13:23 PM):  i think we do righ tnow
julie (19:13:24 PM):  breathing the air
julie (19:13:27 PM):  im already use to it
josh (19:13:29 PM):  polluted air
irene (19:13:31 PM):  the earth is already polluted
irene (19:13:33 PM):  think of nyc
tia (19:13:33 PM):  gin, honey, gin
irene (19:13:35 PM):  the air can't be good
cinthia (19:13:37 PM):  i like vodka vicky
julie (19:13:46 PM):  mmhmm
irene (19:13:49 PM):  YUM
vicky (19:13:49 PM):  so I guess I'd say I'd rather have clean air
vicky (19:13:53 PM):  ...
irene (19:13:54 PM):  i don't know
irene (19:14:01 PM):  i feel like we can't choose between water and air
julie (19:14:03 PM):  we'll just have to drink and forget that the world has problmes
irene (19:14:04 PM):  both are mandatory
tia (19:14:05 PM):  Well, we already breathe polluted air
cinthia (19:14:09 PM):  true
irene (19:14:10 PM):  good solution julie
irene (19:14:16 PM):  as long as it's not TOO polluted
tia (19:14:21 PM):  We do not drink polluted water, basically
julie (19:14:23 PM):  yes
cinthia (19:14:28 PM):  ps we all gotta meet up tn!
cinthia (19:14:31 PM):  DOWNTOWN ALBANY
irene (19:14:33 PM):  idk i've heard people testing tap water they think is ok but it has a lot in it
irene (19:14:47 PM):  cinthia if you knew a party it woudl happen
tia (19:14:48 PM):  Yes, there are many things they do not test for
julie (19:14:54 PM):  downtown... that's also polluted
luke (19:14:55 PM):  cinthia u sound like u have indulged in friday night festivities early
irene (19:14:57 PM):  and then we can have face to face sessions and discuss
tia (19:15:01 PM):  Part of the problem they are finding out is the prescription medicines
irene (19:15:08 PM):  ohg yeah i've heard about that
tia (19:15:10 PM):  But overall, we do not drink polluted water
cinthia (19:15:10 PM):  irene i do
cinthia (19:15:12 PM):  i live on hudson
irene (19:15:19 PM):  because people flush it down the toilets
tia (19:15:23 PM):  When's the last time brown water came out of your pipes?
irene (19:15:23 PM):  which makes no sense
cinthia (19:15:29 PM):  ok anyways. no luke i have not partaken in an festivites yet
irene (19:15:35 PM):  it happened to me once here, i live on empire
julie (19:15:38 PM):  YET
cinthia (19:15:44 PM):  key word
julie (19:15:46 PM):  lol
julie (19:15:57 PM):  but it will laters =)
irene (19:16:01 PM):  there's snow
irene (19:16:04 PM):  what if it was acid snow
irene (19:16:06 PM):  like acid rain
irene (19:16:07 PM):  but snow
rebecca (19:16:13 PM):  that would suck...
vicky (19:16:13 PM):  well we do have acid rain
julie (19:16:14 PM):  that sounds dangerous
luke (19:16:14 PM):  our cars would be screwed
vicky (19:16:17 PM):  so the snow is likely acid as well
tia (19:16:23 PM):  In fact, many of us voluntarily pollute our lungs with smoke
julie (19:16:29 PM):  yes
julie (19:16:31 PM):  of all kinds
irene (19:16:31 PM):  i think we should drink polluted water aka vodka and discuss this exact topic
vicky (19:16:31 PM):  it's not a low ph like something that would eat paint, at least not at this point
irene (19:16:35 PM):  i think we would gather some great ideas
vicky (19:16:38 PM):  but it's acidic enough to mess with ecosystems
vicky (19:16:42 PM):  wildlife in lakes, etc
luke (19:16:44 PM):  irene i like your style
julie (19:16:57 PM):  yea
irene (19:16:59 PM):  thanks luke w
julie (19:17:01 PM):  you crazy gurlllll
cinthia (19:17:03 PM):  shucks
vicky (19:17:19 PM):  I think this discussion is going to degrade into a drinking game
vicky (19:17:24 PM):  :P
julie (19:17:26 PM):  lets!
cinthia (19:17:26 PM):  oh good thought
rebecca (19:17:27 PM):  im ok with that
luke (19:17:29 PM):  probably would pass the time better
julie (19:17:32 PM):  it is a friday
irene (19:17:33 PM):  true
cinthia (19:17:37 PM):  everytime we say one of the words in 1-5 we drink
irene (19:17:38 PM):  as long aswe mildly stay on topic
irene (19:17:54 PM):  because $10 can get 10 slices of pizza at mild wallys
julie (19:17:58 PM):  prepare to get smashed
irene (19:17:58 PM):  and to risk that would be devastating
luke (19:18:05 PM):  haha we are going to have to give 15 dollars to research after this convo instead of making money
julie (19:18:05 PM):  water
julie (19:18:06 PM):  air
irene (19:18:09 PM):  hahahah
julie (19:18:10 PM):  pollution
julie (19:18:15 PM):  atmosphere
julie (19:18:22 PM):  forests!
vicky (19:18:24 PM):  julie is binge drinking
julie (19:18:24 PM):  drink!!!
irene (19:18:25 PM):  OZONE LAYER
rebecca (19:18:26 PM):  i cant line up my shots that quick!
cinthia (19:18:31 PM):  WHOAAA SHOTS
julie (19:18:34 PM):  ok ill wait
cinthia (19:18:39 PM):  slow down i need to count
cinthia (19:18:55 PM):  okkkk GO
cinthia (19:18:57 PM):  haha jk
josh (19:19:09 PM):  not funny
julie (19:19:12 PM):  pastures
irene (19:19:16 PM):  hey
irene (19:19:21 PM):  negativity is bad for the enviornment
cinthia (19:19:23 PM):  josh shut ur yap
vicky (19:19:24 PM):  oooook
vicky (19:19:26 PM):  so
vicky (19:19:27 PM):  a
julie (19:19:27 PM):  lmao
vicky (19:19:28 PM):  b
julie (19:19:33 PM):  still b
vicky (19:19:33 PM):  1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 :)
irene (19:19:35 PM):  a or b'
luke (19:19:40 PM):  well.... if we are talking about pollution i would take away polluted air because water does go into many of our drinks and such
julie (19:19:43 PM):  we covered that irene
tia (19:19:56 PM):  I say a 1
tia (19:20:06 PM):  Sorry a 5
luke (19:20:06 PM):  same here
cinthia (19:20:08 PM):  1
josh (19:20:13 PM):  i agree
luke (19:20:16 PM):  a-1
julie (19:20:18 PM):  i say 5
josh (19:20:20 PM):  A 5
irene (19:20:25 PM):  i say split it and do both
rebecca (19:20:26 PM):  i still have no idea..
irene (19:20:28 PM):  and if they argue
irene (19:20:30 PM):  we'll fight them
vicky (19:20:41 PM):  I'd go with 1 or 5 I think
vicky (19:20:43 PM):  hard to pick
julie (19:20:51 PM):  b-5
vicky (19:20:54 PM):  both are very important, and both can be used as clean energy
julie (19:20:55 PM):  final decision
tia (19:21:01 PM):  But only $100,000 to spend
irene (19:21:07 PM):  that's a decent amount
irene (19:21:10 PM):  i think
irene (19:21:10 PM):  actually maybe not
irene (19:21:16 PM):  i mean even if we spend itwhat can we do
julie (19:21:17 PM):  ill take it
tia (19:21:20 PM):  We have no control over air from elsewhere, and air keeps moving
irene (19:21:23 PM):  tell people not to pollute the air? we can't monitor that
tia (19:21:25 PM):  air knows no boundaries
vicky (19:21:26 PM):  it's really not much to affect something like pollution
vicky (19:21:33 PM):  I keep thinking back to windmills
vicky (19:21:47 PM):  maybe the $100k could be used to develop an intermediate storage of electricity
irene (19:21:54 PM):  maybe
vicky (19:21:56 PM):  since the grid has trouble handling the fluctuations of wind power
tia (19:22:03 PM):  I think each windmill costs more than $100,000 to build
vicky (19:22:04 PM):  something to slow it down when it's roaring
luke (19:22:14 PM):  yeaa probably costs more than that
tia (19:22:14 PM):  that is, the big ones we see on hilltops
vicky (19:22:16 PM):  and to send out stored energy when it's slow
julie (19:22:23 PM):  if we utilize water appropriately we wouldnt be polluting
rebecca (19:22:36 PM):  yea maybe one resource is more important than another but $100,000 wont be enough to help it..
irene (19:22:38 PM):  it's too ideal
tia (19:22:39 PM):  the windmills that go on residential rooftops can cost $10-20,000.00 each
vicky (19:22:50 PM):  well I'm not discussing building a windmill
tia (19:22:55 PM):  So you'd be talking only 5-10 homes
vicky (19:22:58 PM):  it's a known technology
irene (19:22:59 PM):  no one is going to agree to get windmills on their houses if they have to pay for i
julie (19:22:59 PM):  i think theyre are more important issues
vicky (19:23:08 PM):  I'm thinking of developing something to use it more effectively, in line with b
vicky (19:23:10 PM):  (efficiency)
cinthia (19:23:20 PM):  we should wear windmill hates
julie (19:23:26 PM):  yes!
cinthia (19:23:36 PM):  hats*
luke (19:23:38 PM):  lol i was gonna say buy 100,000 mini fans from the dollar store
julie (19:23:40 PM):  i got you
irene (19:23:43 PM):  ok if you can find a windmill hat

moderator (20:02:10 PM):  Yes, one tomo and one on Sunday.
moderator (20:02:20 PM):  no more for today though.

moderator (10:00:54 AM):  Good morning!
julie (10:00:59 AM):  hello
eva (10:01:01 AM):  hello
rebecca (10:01:03 AM):  hi
cinthia (10:01:04 AM):  hello!
caroline (10:01:12 AM):  hi
moderator (10:01:14 AM):  Here is the topic guys. link
moderator (10:02:03 AM):  julie, would you mind being the leader today? You have to ensure the discussion stays on track and that a consensus is reached.
julie (10:02:20 AM):  sure
moderator (10:02:43 AM):  Great, thanks. You may begin whenever you are ready.
julie (10:03:39 AM):  i guess we should discuss one at a time
eva (10:03:57 AM):  discuss each candidate?
julie (10:04:02 AM):  yes sorry
eva (10:04:08 AM):  np thanks :-)
julie (10:04:26 AM):  first officer all alan
caroline (10:04:58 AM):  my wireless seems to be really slow right now, i don't know why, because everything is coming in groups all at once, so if my responses are delayed...that's why
julie (10:05:25 AM):  and whether his characteristics match up with the job description
julie (10:05:37 AM):  ok np
rebecca (10:06:12 AM):  so hes physically and mentally fit
julie (10:06:30 AM):  yes
eva (10:06:43 AM):  hrmmm
eva (10:06:52 AM):  not sure how that's super useful to any of the tasks listed
rebecca (10:07:00 AM):  yea me either
eva (10:07:02 AM):  most of them seem more cerebral than physical
cinthia (10:07:06 AM):  im sorry guys which one are we talking about?
rebecca (10:07:10 AM):  alan
cinthia (10:07:12 AM):  thanks
josh (10:07:14 AM):  yea he should not get the promotion
rebecca (10:07:31 AM):  what would mentally fit even mean though?
josh (10:07:47 AM):  its a good quality to have but it doesnt really fit the criteria we have to choose from
julie (10:07:56 AM):  i agree
jake (10:08:04 AM):  hello
eva (10:08:11 AM):  I think mentally fit refers to a general state of mind
cinthia (10:08:16 AM):  this is more of like a office job id think
eva (10:08:17 AM):  like dementia is not mentally fit
josh (10:08:20 AM):  hes probably calm and can deal with situations easily
rebecca (10:08:26 AM):  so hes sane... thats a plus
caroline (10:08:46 AM):  i wouldn't completely eliminate him because the mental fitness is definitely a plus
julie (10:08:48 AM):  yes
jake (10:09:04 AM):  i vot for either dwight or clark
caroline (10:09:07 AM):  i don't know how you distinguish that from "intelligence and presence of mind" though
rebecca (10:09:13 AM):  yea because this is a lot of coordinating and organizing
cinthia (10:09:17 AM):  i would def vote for clark
julie (10:09:44 AM):  ok well lets agree that alan isnt our manm
julie (10:09:47 AM):  man*
eva (10:10:00 AM):  I vote no Alan
julie (10:10:10 AM):  next is brent
jake (10:10:12 AM):  i think that either clark or dwight would be good because the job description requires a lot of paper work
jake (10:10:20 AM):  and testifying in court
jake (10:10:37 AM):  you ned great communication and written skills for those
jake (10:10:57 AM):  and knowledge of the law - specifically criminal law
cinthia (10:11:03 AM):  ya
julie (10:11:17 AM):  what does everyone think of brent?
cinthia (10:11:17 AM):  i specifically like deeper understanding of the criminal mind with dwight
jake (10:11:29 AM):  yes i agree cinthia
rebecca (10:11:41 AM):  caring and compassionate...not so important for this
caroline (10:11:42 AM):  i think brent is so-so
rebecca (10:11:49 AM):  itd be lsightly helpful
julie (10:11:55 AM):  he is caring and compassionate
eva (10:12:08 AM):  just out of curiosity, if the Albany Police *were* more caring and compassionate, would we trust the police more?
jake (10:12:13 AM):  nope
rebecca (10:12:20 AM):  that makes me think he might be too concerned with making others happy
josh (10:12:45 AM):  but thats what police are for
rebecca (10:12:56 AM):  no i mean his subordinates
julie (10:12:56 AM):  yes agreed, but he could be a good qualit when dealing with alot of people
jake (10:12:57 AM):  police are not there to make others happy
josh (10:13:05 AM):  they are public servants
josh (10:13:14 AM):  to help the public
jake (10:13:16 AM):  that dont mean they have the publics interest at heart
jake (10:13:27 AM):  true there are those who like what they do
caroline (10:13:46 AM):  i think i would trust them more if they were caring and compassionate
josh (10:13:46 AM):  yea it matters about who the officer is
josh (10:14:37 AM):  but i also think that brent is not qualified for a promotion just because of his qualities
julie (10:14:40 AM):  so are there any votes for brent?
josh (10:14:44 AM):  no
rebecca (10:14:46 AM):  no
jake (10:14:46 AM):  no
cinthia (10:14:48 AM):  true josh
caroline (10:14:51 AM):  i agree with josh...no
julie (10:14:56 AM):  ok no brent!
julie (10:15:03 AM):  clark?
julie (10:15:11 AM):  why is he a good candidate
rebecca (10:15:26 AM):  Intelligence and Presence of Mind
julie (10:15:38 AM):  i think those are good qualities
eva (10:15:46 AM):  his advantages seem useful for most of the tasks
eva (10:15:50 AM):  I wonder about the last task though
rebecca (10:15:51 AM):  yea i agree
julie (10:15:53 AM):  especially intelligence
cinthia (10:15:54 AM):  thats good for everything ddescribed
eva (10:16:11 AM):  and we don't have any information on *anyone's* managerial skills
caroline (10:16:19 AM):  i think his qualities are probably the most valuable for this posiion
jake (10:16:20 AM):  between dwight and clarkm i vote for
jake (10:16:27 AM):  dwight
rebecca (10:16:44 AM):  i agree with caroline
rebecca (10:17:28 AM):  this position is more than just dealing with criminals though
julie (10:17:40 AM):  yes agreed
rebecca (10:17:43 AM):  theres also a lot of managing subordinates
caroline (10:18:02 AM):  yea there is a lot of managing period
cinthia (10:18:08 AM):  has anyone seen CSI
julie (10:18:13 AM):  presence of mind, seems very important
julie (10:18:21 AM):  especially dealing with police work
cinthia (10:18:22 AM):  im like picturing this job as Grissum or the other dude
josh (10:18:30 AM):  yea clark is my choice
cinthia (10:18:35 AM):  who would best fit that character
jake (10:18:57 AM):  i think being able to understand how the criminal mind works is more important
jake (10:19:07 AM):  you need that intellginece to write reports
jake (10:19:13 AM):  and to testify in courts and investigate
jake (10:19:27 AM):  thats how you catch those badasses
julie (10:19:27 AM):  but clark is intelligent, who says he cant figure the same things
julie (10:19:45 AM):  and you dont have to be that clever when you work for alban police
julie (10:19:49 AM):  albany*
eva (10:19:50 AM):  you know, the more I look at the job description, the more I can see how all of the officer's were picked
josh (10:19:56 AM):  understanding the criminal mind is important but not that important
eva (10:20:00 AM):  because the community reltions task
eva (10:20:07 AM):  or the cultural background task
eva (10:20:14 AM):  or crime investigation
jake (10:20:17 AM):  communirty relations was not said in the description
eva (10:20:21 AM):  it is
eva (10:20:25 AM):  number 5
jake (10:20:37 AM):  oh isee. i stand corrected
eva (10:20:44 AM):  it's not a deal breaker, thse descriptions
eva (10:20:49 AM):  but....food for thought :-)
julie (10:20:51 AM):  yes all these candidates were probably picked for some reason
julie (10:21:01 AM):  lol thank you
caroline (10:21:12 AM):  maybe we should go through the points and see who fits each point
julie (10:21:13 AM):  to make us think
caroline (10:21:17 AM):  and consider whoever fits the most points
julie (10:21:25 AM):  good idea
cinthia (10:21:34 AM):  should someone keep a tally
julie (10:21:39 AM):  ok the first bullet
julie (10:21:41 AM):  i will
julie (10:21:55 AM):  Under general supervision, directs and leads subordinates in enforcing state and federal laws and local ordinances for the Albany PD.
eva (10:22:15 AM):  ...i think i need more info about the officers for that one
caroline (10:22:15 AM):  i vote clark for that
josh (10:22:19 AM):  most likely clark
cinthia (10:22:23 AM):  clark
rebecca (10:22:29 AM):  clark
jake (10:22:35 AM):  ditto
josh (10:22:38 AM):  but alan and dwight can fit too
josh (10:22:45 AM):  but clark is the best fit
julie (10:22:48 AM):  this is true
eva (10:23:05 AM):  does intelligence necessarily make the best manager?
caroline (10:23:13 AM):  it's hard to distinigush mental fitness from intelligence and presence of mind
moderator (10:23:19 AM):  Sorry to interrupt guys, but could you refresh your link page? I forgot to add one item to job desc.
josh (10:23:45 AM):  ok
eva (10:23:46 AM):  haha, Alan will ace that last requirement!
josh (10:23:59 AM):  still say clark
cinthia (10:24:12 AM):  haha
caroline (10:24:14 AM):  well the physical requirement makes a difference but it doesn't seem like all too much physical activity is required in the actual job
jake (10:24:19 AM):  alright guys lets focus. back to the first point
josh (10:24:33 AM):  clark
eva (10:24:33 AM):  i still don't think any of the info we have points to good managerial skills
julie (10:24:38 AM):  who agrees with clark?
eva (10:24:39 AM):  so that one might be moot
josh (10:24:45 AM):  i do
cinthia (10:24:49 AM):  me
julie (10:25:05 AM):  i do as well
jake (10:25:12 AM):  as well as I
caroline (10:25:19 AM):  i do too
julie (10:25:33 AM):  eva and rebecca?
eva (10:25:35 AM):  no vote
eva (10:25:39 AM):  i don't have enough information
julie (10:25:44 AM):  ok fair enough
eva (10:25:46 AM):  (i'm taking a management class right now, if that helps)
eva (10:25:51 AM):  (er
eva (10:25:59 AM):  it's why I can't decide)
julie (10:26:03 AM):  np
julie (10:26:12 AM):  well next point then
julie (10:26:20 AM):  Interprets policies and procedures to apply to law enforcement activities and situations
josh (10:26:37 AM):  clark
cinthia (10:26:42 AM):  ditto
caroline (10:26:43 AM):  dwight
rebecca (10:26:55 AM):  clark
jake (10:26:58 AM):  clark
cinthia (10:27:18 AM):  i can see how u said dwight caroline
caroline (10:27:24 AM):  i could go clark too though
julie (10:27:26 AM):  i think i choose dwight
eva (10:27:33 AM):  Clark
julie (10:27:43 AM):  it just makes the most sense
julie (10:27:50 AM):  .. to me
cinthia (10:28:16 AM):  how?
josh (10:28:23 AM):  understanding th criminal mind doesnt really have to do with that bullet
cinthia (10:28:25 AM):  i kinda see wat ur saying but dk how to word it
julie (10:28:33 AM):  sorry read it wrong
julie (10:28:36 AM):  im tired
julie (10:28:43 AM):  i go with clark
caroline (10:28:45 AM):  clark
jake (10:29:36 AM):  i think for dwight fitting this requirement is if you understand the criminal mind then youd understand which policies and procedures to apply as consequences for his actions
eva (10:30:00 AM):  good point
jake (10:30:08 AM):  kinda like a matter of "fitting" what punishment to use for him
julie (10:30:11 AM):  agreed
caroline (10:30:51 AM):  yes
julie (10:31:07 AM):  hmm
cinthia (10:31:22 AM):  but u dont really "fit" laws to apply to the criminals do u
cinthia (10:31:41 AM):  if they kill someone its murder blah blah
josh (10:31:52 AM):  understanding the criminal mind doesnt mean that you kno the policies n procedures
cinthia (10:31:53 AM):  if theyre insane thats another story that would deal more with dwight
jake (10:32:13 AM):  i think you do - just coz you killed a person dont mean they should get capital punishment... or how do you know how many years to give someone for raping
josh (10:32:21 AM):  dwight only really understands why criminals do what they do
josh (10:32:28 AM):  that all the description gives
caroline (10:32:39 AM):  i gess that's true
jake (10:32:54 AM):  i think if clark's intelligence is more specified - like what is he intelligent about, it would help us
julie (10:32:56 AM):  although i think understanding the criminal mind is important, i think it's a little more than what the bullet qualifies
josh (10:33:12 AM):  well im a criminal justice major and there is way to many different criteria for how a person gets sentenced
julie (10:33:30 AM):  i think he generally is all around intelligent, just catches on and understands quickly
josh (10:33:56 AM):  and that important because they can just teach you things
josh (10:34:04 AM):  so he would learn quicker
jake (10:34:06 AM):  well an argument for clark could be that for situations, if his intelligent to think quickly on his feet given the surpirse of the situation, then he would fit the requirement
caroline (10:34:26 AM):  yes absolutely
jake (10:34:34 AM):  that beinf said, i think i would go for clark
julie (10:34:35 AM):  yes good point
cinthia (10:34:41 AM):  yes
caroline (10:34:44 AM):  yes
julie (10:34:48 AM):  ok, does everyone agree?
julie (10:34:59 AM):  clark again?
jake (10:35:01 AM):  yup. clark is better than dwight for this one
rebecca (10:35:31 AM):  yep
caroline (10:35:35 AM):  yes
jake (10:36:21 AM):  so shall we move on to the next bullet?
julie (10:36:26 AM):  ok well i think most agreed on clark
julie (10:36:31 AM):  so next bullet
julie (10:36:34 AM):  Recommends commendation and disciplinary action.
eva (10:36:51 AM):  maybe Brent
jake (10:36:59 AM):  im between clark and dwight again for this one
caroline (10:37:10 AM):  clark, brent, dwight
josh (10:37:30 AM):  clark
cinthia (10:37:36 AM):  idk if id choose brent cuz hes gonna go easy on people
rebecca (10:37:36 AM):  this means for his subordinates right?
cinthia (10:37:41 AM):  i think so
josh (10:37:46 AM):  yea i think so too
rebecca (10:37:49 AM):  i agree with cinthia on brent
josh (10:38:04 AM):  so dwight doesnt really have anythin to do with this
rebecca (10:38:14 AM):  but idk if anyone else really jumps out at me for this
caroline (10:38:19 AM):  oh ok
julie (10:38:31 AM):  im thinking clark again
jake (10:38:39 AM):  i think this bullet requires both compassion and understanding of the criminal mind
julie (10:38:43 AM):  his qualities are just generally good
josh (10:38:59 AM):  also u dont want someone to be too caring and companionate cuz they may not really punish anyone
rebecca (10:39:08 AM):  if i had to choose someone i would say clark..
josh (10:39:12 AM):  so i go with clark
cinthia (10:39:17 AM):  me too
jake (10:39:19 AM):  coz you might be compassionate but how do you know that what youre proposing to correct his behavior is right for him
rebecca (10:39:40 AM):  thats what i was trying to say abt brent earlier when i said he might care too much
caroline (10:39:50 AM):  ok so clark
eva (10:39:58 AM):  i believe this is for the subordinates not criminals
eva (10:40:04 AM):  i was thinking about the commendations
julie (10:40:08 AM):  yes i believe so
rebecca (10:40:12 AM):  yep
cinthia (10:40:12 AM):  yeh it is
caroline (10:40:34 AM):  yes it is
rebecca (10:40:35 AM):  so like rewarding and reprimanding
josh (10:41:06 AM):  yea
julie (10:41:10 AM):  yes
jake (10:41:59 AM):  if that is the cse, id go for clark
caroline (10:42:08 AM):  clark
irene (10:42:15 AM):  hi sory
cinthia (10:42:16 AM):  clark
julie (10:42:21 AM):  i agree
jake (10:42:22 AM):  the "than the rest" part of his description says to me he is capable of being a leader
julie (10:43:12 AM):  does everyone agree?
jake (10:43:16 AM):  yes
rebecca (10:43:16 AM):  yep
jake (10:43:21 AM):  clark again
caroline (10:43:22 AM):  tes
caroline (10:43:26 AM):  yes*
irene (10:43:42 AM):  sorry my computer keeps locking up
josh (10:43:50 AM):  yup
cinthia (10:43:54 AM):  we might have to speed up a bit tho cuz we only have like 40 mins for the rest of them
julie (10:44:05 AM):  ok clark it is
julie (10:44:08 AM):  next
julie (10:44:11 AM):  Assists in development and implementation of policies and procedures.
cinthia (10:44:18 AM):  dwight
eva (10:44:22 AM):  Clark
jake (10:44:23 AM):  i think im for clark again
cinthia (10:44:38 AM):  development and implementaion
cinthia (10:44:44 AM):  thats what made me think of dwight
caroline (10:44:45 AM):  yes
rebecca (10:44:54 AM):  clark
cinthia (10:45:17 AM):  he undersstands why they do what they do...
caroline (10:45:17 AM):  i guess i can see dwight fitting this to
julie (10:45:29 AM):  hmm i think i might choose dwight for this one
irene (10:45:35 AM):  i think intelligence is priority
rebecca (10:45:39 AM):  idk policies and procedures is so general
caroline (10:45:45 AM):  i'm on the fence
rebecca (10:46:04 AM):  policies and procedures of law.. or for his subordinates
rebecca (10:46:11 AM):  it could go either way
josh (10:46:24 AM):  both
julie (10:46:27 AM):  yes
rebecca (10:46:50 AM):  but either way i think intelligence would be the most helpful
irene (10:46:50 AM):  well they're all good they just have one additional quality above the rest
irene (10:47:06 AM):  so i'm sure clark can do it all
cinthia (10:47:15 AM):  true
caroline (10:47:40 AM):  hah yea clark is like the super human
cinthia (10:47:40 AM):  how many tallys does each have julie
julie (10:47:41 AM):  but for this particular bullet i think dwight fits it best
irene (10:47:51 AM):  oh
julie (10:48:02 AM):  so far all clark
cinthia (10:48:12 AM):  haha
jake (10:48:12 AM):  where is the person who is a criminal justice major?
josh (10:48:25 AM):  that be me
jake (10:48:33 AM):  what is you take on this one josh?
julie (10:48:49 AM):  were probably just gunna choose clark, but might as well go through the bullets to waste time
irene (10:48:59 AM):  yeah
josh (10:49:08 AM):  heres my thing
josh (10:49:16 AM):  clark is the best by far
josh (10:49:42 AM):  dwight only shows that he understands criminals and what they do
josh (10:50:03 AM):  that is more of a psychology or criminal theory approach
jake (10:50:14 AM):  ya like he should be behind a desk
caroline (10:50:31 AM):  he's more of a detective
josh (10:50:36 AM):  or a crime scene investigator
irene (10:50:37 AM):  good point
josh (10:50:39 AM):  yea
jake (10:50:42 AM):  but not like will smith and martin lawrence in bad boys
irene (10:50:47 AM):  haha
eva (10:50:49 AM):  i wonder what would happen if it turned out that Clark is an asthmatic schizophrenic...
josh (10:50:50 AM):  no lol
julie (10:50:52 AM):  badass
jake (10:50:57 AM):  clark is the one they go to to get info
irene (10:51:14 AM):  he;s smart so he can handle any situation
julie (10:51:14 AM):  cause he's intelligent lol
eva (10:51:16 AM):  right..but what if he was sickly and not right in the head?
cinthia (10:51:24 AM):  haahh
eva (10:51:27 AM):  despite his intelligence?
irene (10:51:27 AM):  good point!
irene (10:51:32 AM):  a lot of people are smart but insane
cinthia (10:51:32 AM):  but lets assume that he doesnt have that
irene (10:51:33 AM):  haha
eva (10:51:33 AM):  he stil has to take the exam...poor clark
josh (10:51:44 AM):  its says he has presence of mind
julie (10:51:47 AM):  it says presence of mind
rebecca (10:51:47 AM):  "All of them have an excellent track record so far. "
irene (10:51:51 AM):  yeah
eva (10:51:54 AM):  i'm looking at the last bullet point
irene (10:51:56 AM):  so he hasn't gone schizo yet
julie (10:52:02 AM):  nope
josh (10:52:13 AM):  and none of these guys would be crazy cuz they are all police officers already
eva (10:52:15 AM):  should we assume that they are all in good physical shape and mental state?
rebecca (10:52:23 AM):  and if he doesnt pass though tests we'll have to move on to our next fav candidate
josh (10:52:33 AM):  they have to pretty much be
julie (10:52:43 AM):  ok lets focus
rebecca (10:52:51 AM):  well we definitely cant assume that one isn't for no reason
josh (10:52:53 AM):  u have to take those tests for each position u go for
julie (10:52:54 AM):  everyone choose clark for this bullet
jake (10:52:58 AM):  i say clark
rebecca (10:53:01 AM):  clark
irene (10:53:04 AM):  clark
cinthia (10:53:07 AM):  yes
josh (10:53:16 AM):  clark
julie (10:53:19 AM):  ok majority rules
julie (10:53:30 AM):  next: Exhibits good community relations by supporting and getting involved in community-oriented policing programs and activities and maintains those good relations by providing quality service.
rebecca (10:53:48 AM):  brent
irene (10:53:51 AM):  brent
cinthia (10:53:52 AM):  brent
eva (10:53:53 AM):  brent
julie (10:53:59 AM):  brent
jake (10:54:02 AM):  brent
josh (10:54:08 AM):  brent
irene (10:54:09 AM):  i feel like these are all obvious
julie (10:54:10 AM):  ok agreed lol
julie (10:54:15 AM):  next
julie (10:54:17 AM):  Effectively utilizes resources by assigning officers, their work and equipment to ensure the proper performance of police functions.
jake (10:54:25 AM):  clark
rebecca (10:54:26 AM):  clark
cinthia (10:54:32 AM):  clark
caroline (10:54:43 AM):  clark
josh (10:54:47 AM):  clark or alan
eva (10:55:10 AM):  clark
cinthia (10:55:12 AM):  yah alan is good i guess
josh (10:55:19 AM):  yea
josh (10:55:25 AM):  actually clark is better tho
jake (10:55:26 AM):  but clark is best
rebecca (10:55:27 AM):  alan would be second for me
caroline (10:55:28 AM):  but what does mental fitness meannnn
jake (10:55:45 AM):  like hes not crazy
julie (10:55:47 AM):  mentally prepared for anything?
josh (10:55:51 AM):  he can deal with situations...keep cool
caroline (10:55:57 AM):  oh ok
caroline (10:55:59 AM):  i like that
caroline (10:56:08 AM):  good interpretation
julie (10:56:14 AM):  ok well i think majority chooses clark
julie (10:56:16 AM):  NEXT
julie (10:56:18 AM):  Coordinates activities at crime scenes.
irene (10:56:18 AM):  hahha
caroline (10:56:34 AM):  what kind of activities
irene (10:56:41 AM):  so vague
rebecca (10:56:43 AM):  yea
josh (10:56:53 AM):  clark
rebecca (10:56:56 AM):  i think clark
irene (10:57:01 AM):  dwight or clark
jake (10:57:05 AM):  i guess like the procedures needed to be done at a secne
rebecca (10:57:08 AM):  because he can manage those like dwight
irene (10:57:32 AM):  i feel like if dwight understands the criminal he can figure out what ot od in a situation
cinthia (10:57:51 AM):  i feel like dwight would be more of like csi
jake (10:57:56 AM):  yaaaaa
rebecca (10:57:57 AM):  me too... but i feel like this position is part of the bigger picture
irene (10:58:03 AM):  good point
julie (10:58:09 AM):  yes agreed
caroline (10:58:15 AM):  yea i like "part of the bigger picture" that seems true
rebecca (10:58:56 AM):  because theres probably a lot of dwights working there... someone needs to manage them efficiently
jake (10:59:02 AM):  i just think dwight is for behind the desk type of guy. not the on the secne type of guy
cinthia (10:59:02 AM):  haha
cinthia (10:59:08 AM):  like in the office
irene (10:59:11 AM):  yeah true
jake (10:59:26 AM):  dwight works for clark
rebecca (10:59:28 AM):  yea i might think he shouldnt get the promotion bc of the office...
julie (10:59:30 AM):  haha i hope not
irene (10:59:31 AM):  hahah yes jake
jake (10:59:38 AM):  lol
caroline (10:59:39 AM):  yes lol
julie (11:00:13 AM):  ok so im guessing this one goes to clark again?
eva (11:00:16 AM):  i'm sorry...I've lost track of which bullet we are on
jake (11:00:24 AM):  yes - clark it is
julie (11:00:35 AM):  Coordinates activities at crime scenes.
irene (11:01:03 AM):  that's what we just did
julie (11:01:13 AM):  i vote clark... again
josh (11:01:17 AM):  clark
eva (11:01:23 AM):  ah thanx - clark
julie (11:01:31 AM):  but she forgot the topic
irene (11:01:34 AM):  arent we on next bullet
jake (11:01:37 AM):  good working pace people. on to the next one as jay z says
irene (11:01:39 AM):  oooo
julie (11:01:54 AM):  lol
julie (11:02:19 AM):  im just gunna give that to clark
julie (11:02:22 AM):  next
julie (11:02:29 AM):  Investigates crimes and performs or directs apprehension activities.
rebecca (11:02:40 AM):  dwight
caroline (11:02:49 AM):  yes
josh (11:03:02 AM):  could be either clark or dwight but ill go with dwight
irene (11:03:05 AM):  yeah
irene (11:03:08 AM):  dwight
caroline (11:03:17 AM):  dwight
cinthia (11:03:18 AM):  dwight
julie (11:03:26 AM):  i think i choose dwight as well
jake (11:03:34 AM):  well the "investigates" part is for dwight. but i dont think he could "preform" or "direct" - he might give recommendations but i dont know if he can "perform" or "direct"
